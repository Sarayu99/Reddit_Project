This means that as the virus replicates, it accumulates tiny mutations that don’t necessarily affect its function but do affect the way the immune system can recognize it. One person can have several HIV variants circulating in their body all at once.\\\\n\\\\n&gt; “The virus is a swarm,” Greene says. “It’s not a species, it’s a swarm of different variants.”\\\\n\\\\n----\\\\n\\\\n&gt; On top of this carelessness-as-survival-mechanism, HIV infects the very immune cells that would normally help clear a virus. The antibodies a person makes in short-term response to infection don’t block HIV infection—they aren’t neutralizing. And what are called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which can block many variants from entering cells, can take years for the body to develop, Greene says.\\\\n\\\\n&gt; This is why some vaccine candidates, like Moderna’s, are trying to coax out those broadly neutralizing antibodies sooner, he says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore reading sources (all very good IMHO):\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.aidsmap.com/news/feb-2022/why-did-hiv-vaccine-fail-imbokodo-trial\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2234358/\",\"author\":\"mcptz\",\"score\":-1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666897571,\"parent_id\":\"yere7r\",\"link_id\":\"yere7r\",\"retrieved_on\":1667876568,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu11zyn\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666899212,\"parent_id\":\"yeivce\",\"link_id\":\"yeivce\",\"retrieved_on\":1667876374,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu121b9\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Well I’m asking about the scientific explanation behind something that I personally experienced.

So yes, if you charged $3 billion for that first dose, every other one is just cost of manufacturing, but depending on some compound (like biologics, manufacturing is actually quite expensive). \\\\n\\\\nHowever that's not how it works. A drug company gets very little time 'on market' to make their drug before generics can come in (10 years or now often less). \\\\n\\\\nSo say we get 10 years are best to make back that $3 billion with zero profit.  If we sell a million doses a year, each shot is $300 just to break even. \\\\n\\\\nThe moment a generic manufacturer can come in, your ability to 'recoup' the investment is essentially zero. \\\\n\\\\nVaccines are exceptionally tricky, unless you are selling them to governments, people will not buy them at the cost it took to make them or the vaccine is often a one time injection instead of a lifetime of pills. \\\\n\\\\nSocialized medicine often means for somethings negotiation can happen, when there are alternatives available, or buying power, however with the case of things like vaccines, usually governments pay 'full price' and you pay very little, (except you are actually paying for it with your taxes).\",\"author\":\"bruce_kwillis\",\"score\":-2,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666899462,\"parent_id\":\"iu0y1qe\",\"link_id\":\"yere7r\",\"retrieved_on\":1667876345,\"controversiality\":1,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu12p8m\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666899487,\"parent_id\":\"yere7r\",\"link_id\":\"yere7r\",\"retrieved_on\":1667876341,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu0z71h\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Thank you for your submission!

You correctly expect a positron on the right side of your reaction because of conservation of electric charge.. But why? Well conservation of electric charge is a consequence of the law of the force of electomagnetism. In radioactive decays the 'Weak' interaction comes into play and is in some ways similar to the electromagnetic force (and different in some ways and slightly more complicated). But it is similar in the way that there are also charges that must be conserved in the Weak interaction. In particular there is something called lepton number for each flavour of lepton which are the electron, muon and tauon. And this lepton number must be conserved.\\\\n\\\\nBut this comment on the neutrino and momentum conservation is indeed important, and it is an obvious question - why do we 'need' the neutrino. Historically we saw several types of radioactive decay and some of them (alpha and gamma) always had a fixed energy of the emitted particle e.g. gamma decay of an excited nucleus A\\\\\\\\*-&gt;A+gamma. Energy and momentum conservation of such a process where 1 particle turns into 2 predicts that the emitted particle will always have the same energy in every decay.\\\\n\\\\nHowever for beta decays where an electron is emitted it was observed that the electron energy was a spectrum up to some upper energy - contradicting the 1 to 2 particle decay and therefore physicists postulated the existence of an additional very light particle being emitted in this decay such that the energy was split between the electron and the postulated 'neutrino' as this could explain the spectrum seen.

In that case the cells were used in research but not for production of the mRNA in actual vaccines, and HEK cells are an immortalized cell line, far removed at this point from any viable embryos.\",\"author\":\"sometimesgoodadvice\",\"score\":35,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666907648,\"parent_id\":\"iu1ki51\",\"link_id\":\"yere7r\",\"retrieved_on\":1667875378,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu1nl95\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666907730,\"parent_id\":\"yere7r\",\"link_id\":\"yere7r\",\"retrieved_on\":1667875370,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu1ip14\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"It’s sad to see, and likely more commonplace in the short term.

Turn the wheel on a car and it responds right away. The tires are also physically contacting th ground, so there is lots of friction to effect a course change. In the big planes, the plane is much heavier. On the order of 100 tonnnes, not two tonnes for a car. So there is far more momentum to effect. The pilot applies a correction with the control yoke. You see the yoke love. The control surfaces then move. The correction starts to take effect and the pilot neutralizes the yoke or puts in a different correction. Since the momentum is much larger, from a video you may not notice the movement of the plane much, but the pilot certainly does. Remember, since it is heavy it also takes a bit to start moving, so if you put in a correction at the exact moment you start to notice the plane needing a correction, you won’t need to keep the correction on for as long. \\\\n\\\\nBig ships are exactly the same (hundreds to hundreds of thousands of tones). .

You'd have to have something that would rather dramatically affect Mar's orbit to have ANY impact on the Earth.  Even something that shifted its orbit noticeably would like have no significant direct impact on Earth given the distance involved.\\\\n\\\\nSo you'd have knock mars so completely off its normal orbit that it somehow intersected with Earths orbit or came pretty close, which would be...very bad.  Either you'd end up with a direct collision which would wipe out all life on earth or you'd get close enough to disrupt earths orbit and probably throw the moon out of whack as well, which would probably also end up ending all life on earth and you'd probably eventually end up with an Earth/Mars impact eventually.\\\\n\\\\nThe other possibility is an impact large enough to shatter mars.  Depending on how it happened you COULD see most of Mars remain in its current or similar orbit, simply as pieces akin to the asteroid belt.  However its also possible that some of those pieces, including possibly large ones, could be knocked into orbits that would collide with Earth which would obviously be bad.\\\\n\\\\nAnd its possible, that any impact large enough to knock Mars significantly out of orbit and/or break it apart would be one and the same so the above scenarios might be the same scenario in the end.\\\\n\\\\nThe moon, being closer requires less dramatic, though still pretty significant impacts to have an affect on the earth.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst you have an impact that disrupts the orbit of the moon but not enough to knock it into earth or out of earths orbit completely.  The immediate effect would be on the tides and thus global climate.  Depending on how close or how far it gets these effects might be more or less dramatic.  This would absolutely affect life on earth but might be survivable depending.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, you've got the simple doomsday scenario a moon/earth collision impact.  The moon hitting the earth would be an extinction event, plain and simple.  The earth MIGHT not lose all life, but if anything does survive its probably bacteria or stuff around thermal vents or something like that.  Humans would be screwed.\\\\n\\\\nThird, is the broken moon event, which while less catastrophic than the direct moon impact is likely still very very bad.  An impact of that power is all but assured to send some sizable chunks of the moon into the earth which would be likely cataclysmic.  Assuming by some fluke of probability no major chunks impact earth in the immediate term your still going to lose the tides and see massive changes to the weather and ecosystem as a result.  Eventually SOME of those lunar pieces are going to come down, and depending on the size it could be really really bad.\\\\n\\\\nSo yeah, either the impact isn't big enough to have any near term effect (if any) OR we are seriously screwed.  There's not a lot of scenarios where the event is enough to have some non-catastrophic impact on earth, aka mild side effects or something.\",\"author\":\"urzu_seven\",\"score\":3,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666928682,\"parent_id\":\"yf22zc\",\"link_id\":\"yf22zc\",\"retrieved_on\":1667873301,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu2wlzo\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Also irrelevant for radioactivity.

Maybe in the first billion years or so of the solar system when there were huge planetesimals still playing cosmic pinball, but not now. \\\\n\\\\nHere's the longer answer:\\\\n\\\\nTo start with, the only things affecting the moon or Mars that could *potentially* affect life on Earth are the moon breaking up/changing orbit or Mars breaking up/changing orbit in such a way that it affects our orbit in the long term, and this assumes the change is such that life cannot adapt and/or we somehow lose the things that make it habitable here like a thick atmosphere and liquid water. In the case of the moon undergoing a change due to an impact, the effect on Earth would be pretty quick in geologic terms. For Mars, any change we see here would take longer because it takes time for planetary systems to reach a new gravitational equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\nTo make any of these things happen you would either need something like a massive body impacting the moon/Mars or some kind of gravitational hijinks like a rogue black hole or rogue planet passing through the solar system. Even asteroids similar to the size that caused the K-Pg extinction 66 million years ago would have no real effect on Earth *unless it hit Earth*. Even something large enough to create an impact basin like the South Pole-Aitken basin on the moon (2500 km diameter) or Hellas Planitia on Mars (2300 km diameter) wouldn't affect us here. Such an event on the moon would kick up a lot of debris, some of which would fall to Earth, but any resulting impact from debris would not be large enough to cause a mass extinction or render Earth inhabitable.\\\\n\\\\nImpact events generate a LOT of energy but unless it's an exceptionally massive impact event that *literally changes the orbit of the moon or Mars* it isn't going to do much to us unless the impact event occurs here, on Earth. It takes a ton of energy to shift the orbit of something as massive as a planet and there aren't any gigantic rogue planetesimals swinging through the solar system like there were billions of years ago.\\\\n\\\\nThe next question is, are you asking about long term habitability or about something immediately catastrophic? Because there's only one scenario I can think of that would cause immediate, catastrophic damage to life on Earth and that's the moon breaking up and sending some serious debris headed our way. Any other scenario I mentioned could potentially affect habitability in the long term but wouldn't result in a mass extinction event within your lifetime or perhaps not for millions of years. \\\\n\\\\nFor the sake of argument, let's suspend what we know about the solar system and physics and assume a massive impact might actually happen. Yes, it is absolutely possible for a massive impact event on another body to affect us. It's absolutely possible for a sufficiently large impact to render Earth inhabitable in the long term. However the impact required to cause immediate catastrophe would need to be sufficiently large to actually shift the orbit of the body it's impacting in such a way that the moon breaks up/is pushed into a closer orbit (which could mean it impacts Earth in the future). Short of Mars being yeeted from the solar system, even the entire planet breaking up wouldn't have much effect on us here for at least thousands of years and probably closer to the scale of a million years or longer because again, it takes time for the solar system to reach a new gravitational equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\nThis topic has been addressed in scifi.

Dating will often be a multi step process involving determining the age of both the rock itself, and everything around it from soil sediments to artifacts found at the site.\\\\n\\\\nIn geocience, radiometric dating techniques often form the baisis for age measurements of rock, and work by measureing the relative abundance of radioactive isotopes of elements compared to the stable isotopes they decay to. If the isotope's half life is known, and the isotope it decays to is rare, scientists can determine how long it has been since a rocks formation from how much of the radioactive isotope has decayed to the more stable form. Techniques like Fission track dating of the damage trails left by the decay of unstable Thorium isotopes, U-Pb isotope dating of zircon crystals or glass or Potassium/Argon isotope dating are all examples of this technique and can determine the age of formation of a rock. (Lowe, D., 2011. Tephrochronology and it's application a review. In Quaternary Geochronology. V6 3-4 pp 423, Ch 9, has a good summary of these techniques)\\\\n\\\\nThe ages determined by these methods won't determine the age of a stone structure however, only the ages of the stones in the structure, which will only give an estimate of maximum age. This can be millions of years off depending on the type of rock. Electron spin resonance is a radiometric technique that can give an idea of when a surface was exposed if the stone is worked (Grun, R., 1997. Electron Spin Resonance Dating. In Chronometric Dating In Archeology vol 2), but these analytical techniques tend to be used in tandem with relative, and age equivalent dating techniques in archeological studies. These work by determining the ages of things around the structure (such as soil built up around the base of a stone, artifacts found on site, etc) to determine ages the structure can't be younger than.\\\\n\\\\nDetermining the age of organic matter in the soil built up around a stone since it was emplaced, or of human remains or artifacts found at the site can give a good estimate for the age of a stone. This can be done reliably using Radiometric dating of C14. Another good example of age equivalent dating is tephrochronology, dating using volcanic deposits. As volcanic material is emplaced in a wide radius over the course of a few weeks at most, if you radiometrically date the age of volcanic ash overlaying a stone structure you can use that to get a date the rocks cant have been emplaced after. The same can be done for ash layers under the stone get estimates of maximum age (Lowe 2011). If buildup of sediments around a stone is consistant or seasonal, you can estimate how long a stone has been in one place by how much sediment has built up around it, though this can be unreliable over very long timescales. A combination of deposition modeling, and of relative dating of prior and recent structures and deposits can then be used to establish a range of dates between which the stone must have been emplaced, and to estimate a precise date within that range for when the rock was emplaced.\\\\n\\\\nHope this answers your question!\",\"author\":\"africabytotoaoe\",\"score\":4,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666930312,\"parent_id\":\"yepxg7\",\"link_id\":\"yepxg7\",\"retrieved_on\":1667873166,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu3jugs\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666945696,\"parent_id\":\"iu1dsjh\",\"link_id\":\"ydc8h6\",\"retrieved_on\":1667872221,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu3f3y4\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"To add to what u/Cautemoc said, corticosteroids actually cause the loss of bone mass.\",\"author\":\"bax_cadarn\",\"score\":5,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666941591,\"parent_id\":\"iu332zx\",\"link_id\":\"yf1q0h\",\"retrieved_on\":1667872440,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu3jxay\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"If mars were but by such a large impact to leave the system as it left depending on its angle it would affect orbits of asteroids in the belt and some of those could hit earth.\",\"author\":\"cryptocaned\",\"score\":38,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666945764,\"parent_id\":\"iu2xayx\",\"link_id\":\"yf22zc\",\"retrieved_on\":1667872218,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu3fh5c\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Again I’m thinking in terms of quantity, right now we are thinking that maybe we can deflect one.

That means you must consider two states: what you have with the bond intact and what you have without the bond intact. The latter state especially can be highly environment dependent. \\\\n\\\\nSo, for example, the ionic bond between sodium and chloride ions is quite strong in a dry environment (melting pure salt takes a decent amount of energy). But put salt in water and the bond breaks spontaneously. That is because you alter the energy (or free energy to be precise) of the latter state. Similarly, the covalent bond between two oxygen atoms is pretty strong when O2 is floating as gas. But, thankfully for us, inside our bodies, near hemoglobin especially, that bond can be broken at very reasonable energies. Again, the difference is in the latter of the two states.\\\\n\\\\nSo a categorical statement that one bond type always is stronger than the other is not possible. What often is the case is that these energies are considered in vacuum as a reference environment. But that says by itself little about what applies in everyday applications. Because salts tend to be more dependent on whatever solvent we surround them with, as a matter of experience, really strong materials we interact with tend to be more covalent in their bonding. However, metals are an interesting challenge, since say Tungsten is relatively easy to deform, but extremely hard to melt… so even in the vacuum reference environment, these material properties are not as easy to place on a single weak—strong axis.\",\"author\":\"smorgasconfigurator\",\"score\":53,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666961494,\"parent_id\":\"yff8um\",\"link_id\":\"yff8um\",\"retrieved_on\":1667871171,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu42j7p\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Stress as in physical stresses.

If so, is that the absolute maximum energy a photon can have?\\\\n\\\\nYou've gone through another way of deriving the Planck energy, but the Planck energy doesn't represent a maximum energy for a photon. It's just the energy scale at which the effects of quantum gravity, whatever they are, become dominant over currently-known fundamental physics.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;Is the only thing stopping us from generating photons of such (\\\\\"maximum\\\\\") energy, that there are no particles with that kinds of mass which we could annihiliate?\\\\n\\\\nMass doesn't really have much to do with it. Protons have a mass of 938 MeV, but the LHC collides them at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV (13,000,000 MeV). For high-energy collisions, the vast majority of the involved energy is kinetic, and we get it by using particle accelerators.\\\\n\\\\nThere are limits to how much energy we can accelerate particles to at present, and they differ based on the accelerator construction:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- For linear accelerators, current technology has a maximum amount of acceleration per unit distance (limited by things like the speed at which we can turn large electromagnetic fields on and off, and the size of the devices that manipulate those fields). So increasing acceleration capability requires us to either make the accelerator longer or make better technology.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- For circular accelerators (specifically for synchrotrons, as those are the only viable ones at extreme energies), the charged particles accelerating around the ring emit radiation, which means that they lose energy on every lap. The amount of radiation emitted increases drastically with their kinetic energy. So, if your accelerating device imparts a certain amount of energy each lap, you'll eventually reach the point where the energy lost to radiation equals the energy input, and that's your max energy.

The the examples you give are where the bonds can more easily be broken because the intermediate states are more easily reached. I.e. before the O2 is separated out most first have the bonds Bricker and both O2 would be so reactive that in the time they are separate they would just bond back to one another. This requires a lot of energy i.e. to make something catch fire you need to first provide enough energy to do this, usually with something very hot. In our bodies the intermediate state where they are not bound or loosely bound is stabilized by specific molecules in our body making it easier to break the bond in O2. Since this intermediate state is stabilized you don't need the large initial energy to initiate the reaction (some energy is still needed). However, the energy produced is still the same as it depends on the final and initial states only. Edit: while this is true often there is more than one reaction happening such as enthalpy of solvation, solvent- solvent integrations, and solvent solute interactions. \\\\n\\\\nThat said the bond energy of NaCl is 787 kj/Mol and O2 is 498 kj/mol.\\\\n\\\\nIs point out as well your teacher is not correct.

That energy you quote for NaCl assumes the two ions are pulled apart in vacuum. If we then move the respective ion into water, there is a favourable solvation free energy. So the free energy of the final state of separated NaCl in *aqueous solution* is different than had it been done in vacuum. Any intermediate state stabilization, that only alters the kinetics, is not relevant.\\\\n\\\\nThe O2 example is, I admit, a bit different in the details. But in vacuum, if I do a homolytic cleavage of the covalent bond in O2, the two radical oxygen atoms of the final state are far from stable. So any other reactant that can combine with the two oxygen atoms make that final state stabler. The tricker part is that the path from start to finish include at least one transition state. In biology and chemistry, we can alter the kinetics of this cleavage, while leaving the final state the same, by adjusting any catalytic component. That is a more subtle point. My argument is much simpler. In vacuum, O2 is a strong bond because the final state after dissociation is unstable, while in the example system, O2 separates more readily *mostly* because the dissociation does *not* generate two free radical atoms, but one where the atomic oxygen binds to iron.\\\\n\\\\nHence, the strength of a bond must either be defined with a common reference state (vacuum typically as I mention), but then bond strength is a more abstract quantity and less informative of practical questions of stability, robustness etc, or we consider the problem in full, i.e. the stability of initial and final states are part of the analysis.\",\"author\":\"smorgasconfigurator\",\"score\":0,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666980778,\"parent_id\":\"iu5d8ql\",\"link_id\":\"yff8um\",\"retrieved_on\":1667869025,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu5dpdk\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666979508,\"parent_id\":\"iu4iqmg\",\"link_id\":\"yflwfj\",\"retrieved_on\":1667869174,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu5dr9j\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666979529,\"parent_id\":\"yf1q0h\",\"link_id\":\"yf1q0h\",\"retrieved_on\":1667869171,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu5gwj2\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Do we know that the original 2 died, and that exactly 0 have immigrated since then?\",\"author\":\"tedw\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666980806,\"parent_id\":\"iu4pdll\",\"link_id\":\"yf8s4v\",\"retrieved_on\":1667869022,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu5dsmh\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"So, even in an otherwise empty universe an arbitrarily high-energy photon of say...

Looking at syntheses of these different estimates (e.g., [Tajima et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195112005720), [Brown et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL066361), [Sun et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14044), [Freed et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16306744)) highlight the wide range of estimates, generally from 30 to 60 meters of maximum slip along the fault (with some estimates lying outside of these on either side, i.e., &lt;30 and &gt;60). Similarly, estimates of seafloor displacement have varied (and without the actual paper reference, it's hard to know what to make of the particular numbers you include). Generally, there have been similar ranges of coseismic displacement (i.e., displacement during the earthquake, in the direction of slip, from which you could derive vertical and horizontal components of slip) for the seafloor, but most hover around 50 meters (e.g., [Kodaira et al., 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-earth-071719-055216)), i.e., the 50 m is not really a true lateral displacement, but maybe the cited Science paper is something newer that has refined this somewhat agreed upon figure as discussed in Kodaira? Without the actual reference, hard to know. \\\\n\\\\nMore generally, we have broad expectations of relationships between things like earthquake magnitude (which is a function of the [seismic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_moment)), the length of a rupture, the maximum displacement, mean displacement, and the area of the rupture (e.g., [Wells &amp; Coppersmith, 1994](https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/references/wells-coppersmith-1994.pdf)). If we idealize an earthquake rupture as a vaguely elliptical patch along a fault plane with the maximum displacement near the center of that patch (e.g., [this diagram](https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-1024x301.png)), then we could expect that the magnitude of the rupture at the surface with respect to maximum slip at depth will be a function of the depth of the maximum slip area. For Tohoku, because it was a shallow event and because the maximum slip area at depth was quite close to the surface, there ends up being not *that much* difference between maximum slip at depth and maximum surface coseismic displacement. \\\\n\\\\nWith respect to these general expectation however, some important caveats arise:\\\\n\\\\n1) Earthquake ruptures are often not anywhere near an elliptical shape and the distribution of slip within the rupture can be quite complex (and you can see that if you look at some of the maps of finite fault models for the Tohoku or really any large earthquake) so the relationship between maximum slip at depth and slip at the surface can be pretty complex.\\\\n\\\\n2) In terms of relationships between things like magnitude and length and maximum slip, these are also often quite complicated. Tohoku is a good example in that it's sometimes described as a quite \\\\\"compact\\\\\" rupture, i.e., it had very high magnitudes of slip, but over a very small area compared to what you'd expect based on relationships from Wells &amp; Coppersmith or similar. This is highlighted nicely in figure 1 of [Wang et al., 2018](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/14/2/552/528887/Learning-from-crustal-deformation-associated-with) comparing the areal extent and magnitude of slip between the 2004 Sumatra and the 2011 Tohoku event. The former conformed to expected relationship with a huge rupture extent compared to Tohoku, but *small* maximum slip (~14 meters) compared to Tohoku. I.e., Tohoku in terms of relationships between magnitude and either rupture length or maximum slip would be an outlier in Wells &amp; Coppersmith type relations.\\\\n\\\\n3) Finally, with reference to your final line, it's important to remember that the hypocenter is the location of rupture initiation, not the location of maximum slip. Very often these two are not the same and the location of maximum slip on the fault plane can be quite distinct from the hypocenter location.\\\\n\\\\n**In short,** the relationship between surface rupture magnitude and maximum slip magnitude on the fault plane at depth can be quite complex and will depend on the depth of the rupture and the distribution of slip across the rupture area. Tohoku is an extreme example where because the maximum slip at depth was actually quite near the surface, the surface displacements are pretty close to the maximum slip. At the other end, if a rupture is deep enough, it's definitely possible (and actually relatively common) to have no discrete surface displacement (i.e., there is no surface rupture).\",\"author\":\"crustaltrudger\",\"score\":16,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666983355,\"parent_id\":\"yfr0c6\",\"link_id\":\"yfr0c6\",\"retrieved_on\":1667868731,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu585e7\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Not that significant of a problem.

Once the signal from the satellite is locked, the receiver will begin to get data from the satellite.  The satellite's time is one of the data elements in the signal being received.  That's called the GPS signal epoch.  The satellites are all synched together by the GPS Master Station on the ground.  The Master Station uses the USNO Master Time that is based on multiple Cesium-beam atomic clocks.  The Master Station is continuously monitoring the satellite signals and providing tiny corrections to each satellite.  The GPS signal epoch is when the leading edge of the first bit in the signal leaves the satellite.  Time is just another variable in the 4 range equations.  If you are tracking 4 satellites, you can determine X, Y, Z &amp; Time.  If you are tracking more satellites, that gives you an over-determined solution that allows you to reduce measurement errors.  There are lots of other tricks that are done to reduce errors, like using Kalman filters, using the phase shift of the signal, using algorithms that try to reduce multipath errors, modeling the troposphere and the ionosphere, etc, etc.\",\"author\":\"twoflowersluggage\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667019192,\"parent_id\":\"ir4gqox\",\"link_id\":\"xesnhs\",\"retrieved_on\":1667865294,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu7o9kr\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667018421,\"parent_id\":\"yfpujg\",\"link_id\":\"yfpujg\",\"retrieved_on\":1667865348,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu7q4fv\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667019665,\"parent_id\":\"iu553et\",\"link_id\":\"yfpujg\",\"retrieved_on\":1667865263,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu7q8a8\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":8,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667019740,\"parent_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"link_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"retrieved_on\":1667865258,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu6ld68\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1666998151,\"parent_id\":\"yfothk\",\"link_id\":\"yfothk\",\"retrieved_on\":1667867156,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu6lhrz\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"This is so cool.

However, dark matter has a much broader distribution of velocities, both in magnitude and direction.\\\\n\\\\nBasically, ordinary matter is able to cool via inelastic collisions, causing it to lose energy but not angular momentum. Thus it tends to settle into configurations that reduce the ratio of energy to angular momentum, like disks. Note that collisions alone don't suffice for this; energy loss is needed. Within a disk, particles have largely coherent velocities with only a small spread. For example, material within our section of the disk orbits at roughly 220 km/s, but its velocity dispersion is only in the tens of km/s. (The velocity dispersion is the root-mean-squared deviation from the average velocity.)\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, dark matter has no coherent motion, instead moving in random directions with a wide spread of speeds. The local dark matter velocity dispersion is something like 270 km/s.\\\\n\\\\n(It should be noted, though, that many galaxies don't have disks.

Environment and fatigue can also play a role.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Canevelli et al., 2016:\\\\n\\\\nSundowning could caused by a disruption in circadian rhythm due to alteration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), basically the \\\\\"pacemaker\\\\\" of circadian rhythyms, located in the hypothalamus (forebrain). This naturally degenerates with age, but damage to this area is seen even more so in people with AD, as noted by neuronal loss and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. \\\\n\\\\nIn severe AD, the SCN also shows reactive gliosis (the universal response to brain injury) in response to neuronal loss, with an increase in the astrocyte/neuron ratio. Essentially, a physiological response to brain injury in the hypothalamus interfering with regulation of sleep and emotional activity.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, circadian rhythms are regulated by melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland in response to darkness. The pineal gland's Melatonin functions are regulated by the SCN (which we know is damaged in AD). Melatonin is usually greatly reduced in people with AD, effecting circadian rhythms.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Another possible cause is the degeneration of the cholinergic system. The SCN receive several cholinergic projections arising from the cholinergic forebrain and brain stem nuclei. Moreover, it is sensitive to cholinergic stimulation as demonstrated by the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors both in SCN neurons and astroglial cells. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the impaired cholinergic transmission may contribute to the disruption of circadian rhythms and the emergence of behavioral disturbances\\\\\" (Canevelli et al., 2016)\\\\n\\\\nAnother hypothesis is disruption/dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In several studies, people with AD showing sundowning had significantly higher cortisol levels (stress response, regulated by HPA) than those without sundowning.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, environmental impacts such as decreased light exposure during the day (in a facility), fewer staff in late afternoon/evening, fatigue, and changes to or absence of daily routine have been associated with an overall worsening of NPS and the emergence of sundown syndrome\",\"author\":\"orange-enough\",\"score\":3,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667050136,\"parent_id\":\"iu7wmu6\",\"link_id\":\"yfothk\",\"retrieved_on\":1667863466,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu8tn7l\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Ordinary matter and dark matter both exert gravitational forces on each other, so they influence each other collectively.

I say comet because I doubt Phobos or an asteroid is really big enough to kick up enough debris into escape trajectories that it's a problem for Earth. However, if you take a Sedna-like object and give it a tiny kick at apoapsis, it could impact Mars and really throw out an immense amount of ejecta as well as changing Mars' orbit or outright blowing up the planet. Any of those scenarios would be very hazardous to Earth due to both destabilization of the orbits of the inner solar system, and the bombardment of it with ejecta for a very long period.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, the moon. Assuming the object is not enormous, this is a question of where on the moon an object hits. If it hits the east side of the moon, then ejecta is released into orbits or suborbital trajectories of Earth with apogee lower than the moon.\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to recognize that this debris gains substantial energy falling from the moon to Earth. It takes only 2.38 km/s of velocity to get to a lunar escape trajectory and transforming that into a collision course with Earth takes all of 30 m/s more. Yet on impact with Earth it will be moving 11 km/s. That is a nearly 21-fold increase in ejecta energy.\\\\n\\\\nThus, if much debris is kicked up on the moon, there is a high chance that it ends up raining down on Earth at some point. Maybe not immediately. It's not going to all perfectly deorbit, and some of it will land on the moon or escape entirely, but the fact that large amounts of relatively intact ejected debris will probably collide with Earth at some point is likely to cause some damage.\\\\n\\\\nWithout running a simulation I can't really say what the impactor size and location would need to be to cause, e.g. nuclear winter on Earth, respiratory failure of animals, or heating the upper atmosphere into a deadly space heater that sets forest fires, however, as the debris would rain down over a long period, it would probably take pretty large impacts on the moon to cause acute effects on Earth.

Further, most data we can get from human patients is gathered after they die (though I believe there are several long-term clinical trials that are begining to collect patient data during the development of the disease).\\\\n\\\\nSo the issue becomes developing models to study the disease (often in mice and cells cultured on plates). Turns out there's lots of ways to cause a mouse to have neuron degeneration, and not all of them are precisely what causes Alzheimer's disease. As a result, giving an exact and certain answer to this question isn't really possible (if it was we would be a lot closer to treating the disease).\\\\n\\\\nFor the most part, characteristics of the disease involves build up of misformed proteins in the brain. Some form outside of neurons (so called amyloid beta plaques) and some form within neurons themselves (amyloid fibrilary tangles). In most cases, the build up of proteins themselves does not seem to cause disease, but it may be a necessary step in *some* (not all) disease cases. So a lot of research is focused around how the body deals with misfolded proteins (which is related to some forms of cholesterol management, the blood-brain-barrier, waste removal, etc.) and how these proteins are misfolded in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, the nervous system is really complicated system, and there will likely never be a single answer to what causes this disease. It's similar to asking why a car breaks down- anything within the complicated system of a car can cause it to stop working. Sometimes it's an empty fuel tank, sometimes it's a loose cable. Often the breakdown of a car is accompanied with loud knocking or ticking noises from the engine- so it's important to study and understand the cause and effect of the knocking sound- but it's not the only reason a car stops working. Similar to Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques and Tau tangles are often associated with Alzheimer's (and we should ABSOLUTELY study the cause and affect of them) but (in my opinion) it's going to take a lot of dedicated work to understanding more about the nervous system as a whole to say for sure what's going on in any given case of Alzheimer's disease.\",\"author\":\"darthjeff2\",\"score\":2,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667050758,\"parent_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"link_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"retrieved_on\":1667863412,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu8ut23\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667050807,\"parent_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"link_id\":\"yfztqw\",\"retrieved_on\":1667863408,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iu8ox4x\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"I've treated patients with pH less than 6.7 (or lower- the gas machine doesn't go lower).

It's indirect. For example, we can measure the circular orbit velocities of stars. Dark matter must have the same circular orbit velocity (i.e. velocity of a dark matter particle that is on a circular orbit), because it's subject to the same gravity. That's not yet the velocity dispersion, but it's close.\\\\n\\\\nNext, we have observational evidence (e.g. rotation curves, lensing) that dark matter halos extend much farther than galaxies. This suggests that unlike the ordinary matter, the dark matter cannot efficiently cool -- otherwise it would condense into the galaxies as well. In fact the dark matter halos around large galaxies are consistent with what we find in simulations of dark matter that only interacts gravitationally. This suggests that dark matter is effectively collisionless in this context.\\\\n\\\\nSince dark matter halos form by nearly isotropic collapse and accretion -- dark matter comes in from all directions -- their net angular momentum is small. Thus they should have very little net rotational motion and almost all random motion. This is also what the same simulations tell us.\\\\n\\\\nThe specific number \\\\\"270 km/s\\\\\" was a quick estimate I made by taking the [isothermal sphere model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_isothermal_sphere_profile), which is a good approximation for galactic halos over a pretty wide range of radii, and noting that its velocity dispersion is sqrt(3/2) its circular velocity.

There was [Fizeau's experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau_experiment) in 1851 which largely ruled out any aether drag effects, the [Michelson—Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) in 1887 which established the constancy of the speed of light and ruled out the aether wind hypothesis, the Trouton–Noble experiment in 1903, the Rayleigh and Brace experiments between 1902 and 1904, ... there was a wealth of experimental evidence available showing the problems with aether models.  Also it wasn't \\\\\"nearly consensus\\\\\" that aether existed, there was quite a lot of debate all throughout that period as to whether light was a wave (one that travelled in a presumed medium — an aether of some sort) or whether light was a particle or \\\\\"corpuscule\\\\\" (and hence a form of matter that did not require a medium within which to propagate).  Various people proposed either/both wave- or particle-based theories of light and experiments continued to both confirm and refute aspects of each proposed model, all the way from their inception into the early 20th century.  The problems with both kinds of models only really began to start being resolved with the advent of early quantum mechanics and the emergence of wave-particle duality as a feature in physics.\\\\n\\\\nWith the dark matter situation however, you have dozens of kinds of observations that are all in general agreement about dark matter, while those same observations are largely contradicted by the predictions of modified-gravity models.  Unlike with the aether, this isn't a situation where nobody's model fits all the data; with dark matter there is a clear matter-based model that *does* fit all of the data, and then a bunch of alternative models that don't.  That's a pretty huge difference.\\\\n\\\\n&gt;I’m far from an expert, and dark matter seems from what you write proven by many independent sources. But, I can guess, for many, it smells like an esoteric substance stubbornly refusing to be directly identified.\\\\n\\\\nAnd this is the crux of the public relations issue on this topic:  really *only* the people who are \\\\\"far from experts\\\\\" who aren't actually familiar with all of the evidence feel that way.  Among actual experts, the *consensus* is that dark matter exists and that modified gravity models don't actually work.

The first real evidence for dark matter started coming in [almost 100 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Early_history), in the 1930s and 1940s.  The earliest dark matter models were overly simple — just treating galaxies as if they had extra mass — and they had various problems.  Throughout the following decades, models of the cosmos became increasingly sophisticated ... and increasingly conflicted, as every model had some seemingly irreconcilable problems (regardless of dark matter) so it wasn't clear which model was the correct, or even the closest to correct.  As I understand it, during the early 1980s the first modern models of dark matter were proposed, with distributions not matching those of baryonic matter.  And with the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe and the need for a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy, in the late 1980s / early 1990s, enough evidence had come in for cosmologists to hone in on a model that resolved all the issues with the previous competing models — this model is known the Lambda-CDM model (lambda is the symbol for the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations, and CDM stands for \\\\\"cold dark matter\\\\\"); it is also known as the \\\\\"concordance model\\\\\" because it gracefully resolved all the outstanding problems with the previous models of cosmology, and fit the data much better than any of those other models.  Since that time, this model has become known as the \\\\\"standard model of cosmology\\\\\" and has stood out as effectively the only model that actually works and fits all of the data.  Dark matter has been a part of that model since its inception in the early 90s, and in the three decades since all sorts of tweaks, additions, and parameterizations of that model (including its dark matter aspect) have been explored ... as well as many alternative models, none of which have panned out and found success at fitting all of the data well.\\\\n\\\\nSo dark matter has been an accepted part of the modern model of cosmology for at least 3 decades and we've had all manners of more complicated models (and attempts at alternative models) developed during that time.  All sorts of supercomputing simulations of structure formation in the cosmos have been run and their statistics compared to observational datasets, with gradual refinement of the narrower strokes as new data has come in from missions like WMAP and the Planck spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it's been happening this entire time because that's what cosmologists do — that's their job.  It's not like they've been slacking off for half a century; there are tens of thousands of cosmologists and astrophysicists worldwide who have been working on it doing formal research and experimentation/observation for their entire professional careers. :)\",\"author\":\"forte2718\",\"score\":11,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667086592,\"parent_id\":\"iuau5oh\",\"link_id\":\"ygfptx\",\"retrieved_on\":1667859688,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iub3xf3\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":-5,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667086637,\"parent_id\":\"iub2xet\",\"link_id\":\"ygt9yn\",\"retrieved_on\":1667859684,\"controversiality\":1,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuaywbc\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Yes.

This is thought to be more familial, and the genetics being more deterministic. But I should mention this is rare. \\\\n\\\\nAnecdotally, I’ve seen early onset dementia clinically. Patient was in their early to mid 30’s and noticeably impaired. I only worked with them briefly, but what made it interesting was that they had a twin of the same gender (ie same genes) that was unaffected. Now they could have been fraternal, and I was at an early stage of my career so I may not have understood the full picture, but this contradicts some of the literature. \\\\n\\\\nPoint being? You can be tested for genetic risk factors, and if you have a family history of early onset then I think a clearer picture can be ascertained, so I don’t think it’s full stop. But generally no, there is no test currently to say whether you have Alzheimer’s without accompanying symptoms, and even then I’m fuzzy on the diagnostics for a probable AD diagnosis.\\\\n\\\\nEdited to add (source):https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors/genetics\",\"author\":\"gamershark235\",\"score\":3,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667141919,\"parent_id\":\"yh2lh5\",\"link_id\":\"yh2lh5\",\"retrieved_on\":1667855630,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iudkr6w\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"The general idea of wave behavior is that waves reflect when obstructions are repeated and have a gap range smaller than the wavelength (so the wave \\\\\"sees\\\\\" the series of objects as if they are a solid wall). When wavelengths get down into the range of the gap size, diffraction occurs.  When gap sizes are way bigger than wavelength, nothing really happens to the waves. it is as though no such objects were even present.\\\\n\\\\nSo, for your question, you have to consider what the wavelength of the energy is, and for gamma rays it is on the order of picometers (the range is actually several orders of magnitude, but for discussion, 10^11 m is the big end and picometers is 10^-12 m).\\\\n\\\\nThe spacing between atoms in a typical crystal structure is longer than about 100 picometers, so gamma rays, except perhaps the very long end of the range, basically do not see crystalline solids as \\\\\"solid\\\\\" structures (the gaps are big enough that the waves pass through mostly unaffected, as if nothing were there at all). So, there are no crystalline solids which can reflect gamma rays.  You would have to get into subatomic matter and such materials do not cluster in large enough masses to create an important obstruction.\\\\n\\\\nSort of like an island a few km offshore from land.  The small waves do \\\\\"see\\\\\" the island and get blocked and reflected by it, but the overall pattern of waves is unaffected (only a small proportion of the waves are obstructed by the lone object and the rest move on unchanged).  There are no substances we possess or can create which can produce the regular obstructions at the necessary tiny gap size needed to force gamma rays to reflect instead of basically ignore them.\\\\n\\\\nThere are things that can be done using energy fields though, but I don't know much about that at all.

There are certain alleles (gene variants) that give a greater risk of developing it such as the APOE gene. If you have one copy of APOE4 and one APOE3, rather than both copies of APOE3, you have a 3-4 fold chance of developing AD. If you have both copies APOE4 then you have an 8-12 fold risk. There are more genes but this is the largest genetic factor. You can get your genome sequenced which will reveal your genetic susceptibility. If you have high family history of Alzheimer's disease, you likely do have higher genetic susceptibility. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, AD development is also dependent on many environmental/lifestyle factors. The Lancet has identified 14 categories of environmental/lifestyle factors that contribute to the development of AD. These include brain trauma, diet, exercise, pollution, smoking, education and obesity. Many of these, such as diet, smoking and exercise are modifiable so you can reduce your risk of developing AD by altering these, obviously towards being healthier. \\\\n\\\\nWe like to approximate as a broad generalisation that AD development is about 60-70% genetic, and the rest is environmental factors - meaning that the majority of your susceptibility is decided by genetic factors. However, someone with high genetic susceptibility may avoid Alzheimer's due to a healthy lifestyle and a lot of luck. Someone with low genetic susceptibility may develop Alzheimer's due to those lifestyle factors and bad luck as well. Other than family history, genetic sequencing and evaluating your lifestyle, which is only somewhat good at assessing your chance of developing AD, there is no way to know if you will develop it. \\\\n\\\\nThere a diagnostic procedures that can be used to diagnose early stages of AD, however, they are typically not carried out until symptoms start showing as there is no way of spotting it otherwise and it is not a practical way to diagnose diseases. The earliest stage is known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD. You undertake mental examinations (e.g. MMSE tests) to determine cognitive ability and spot any impairment. However, there are a multitude of reasons someone could have MCI, so it cannot be attributed to AD at this stage as it could just be part of normal brain aging. If there is reason to believe it may be due to a neurodegenerative disease like AD then we can do biomarker tests. For AD we can test the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid for molecules produced in the early stages of AD. We look for two things: 1) markers for general neurodegeneration, and 2) markers specific to AD. We can also carry out brain imaging and pick up structures such as tau tangles or amyloid plaques building up in the brain. How soon these markers appearing proceeds cognitive decline and worsening of symptoms varies from person to person. If the cognitive ability of that person continues to decline past MCI, it is assumed to be pathological, not normal aging, and may be a result of a dementia, like AD\\\\n\\\\nGiven that there is no effective disease modifying treatment for AD as of yet, catching it early and getting an AD diagnosis doesn't really help yet.

It's quite far from my niche. But oral infections and inflammation would be one of the most common infections/inflammatory responses seen in the population. Peripheral immune activation from something like a peripheral infection or inflammation causes a cocktail of molecules that enhance inflammatory states to be released into the blood. We're uncertain about the exact effect that these molecules have in the brain, as they do not pass the blood brain barrier. But they do interact with the cells that make up that barrier, which go on to communicate with neurons and other cells in the brain. Inflammation in the brain has been strongly associated with development of Alzheimer's disease (the exact relationship is uncertain). I would suppose that the frequency, both individually and in the population, of infection or inflammation of oral tissue contributes to this association between this and Alzheimer's or other neurological diseases. Illness is one of the environmental factors that contributes to development. I suspect if we saw infections and inflammation in other parts of the body as frequently as we do the oral tissues, they would also be significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, the mouth is exposed to a unique bacterial environment so it may also be the response to the specific pathogens that affect our gum tissue over other areas. \\\\n\\\\nI find the strong link between hearing loss and development of AD much more curious though.

In short, the reason for the below sea level elevations are the mass of the ice and the [isostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy) response of the crust to this mass. \\\\n\\\\nIn detail, the Earth's crust behaves somewhat like a giant elastic sheet. When a surface load, like an ice sheet, is placed on the crust, it deflects downward analogous to how if you put a weight on the center of a trampoline, the surface of the trampoline would deflect downward by an amount proportional to the mass, the distribution of that mass, and the 'rigidity' of the trampoline itself. The added extra complication is that in the analogy, the trampoline is the crust and the air is the mantle, but in reality the mantle is *extremely* viscous, so the flexural response to a mass is not instantaneous (like it effectively is in the trampoline example, because air can flow out of the way beneath the trampoline *very* quickly), i.e., it is dictated by both the elastic properties of the crust, but also the viscosity of the mantle as the mantle has to flow (*reminder* the mantle is a solid, but behaves like a fluid on long timescales, i.e., it's a [rheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheid)) away from the depression to accommodate the deflection. Similarly, when the surface mass is removed (or reduced), there will be an isostatic/flexural response, i.e., the surface elevation will 'rebound'. When this is discussed in reference to reduction of ice sheet mass, this is described as [glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) or 'glacial rebound'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound). Because of the moderating effect of the high viscosity of the mantle (i.e., it takes time for the mantle to flow back to allow for rebound), GIA is actually still occurring from large ice sheet reductions during the end of the last glacial period, and we can [measure the vertical rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound#/media/File:PGR_Paulson2007_Rate_of_Lithospheric_Uplift_due_to_post-glacial_rebound.png) at which the Earth's surface is still rebounding in response to melting of the large northern hemisphere ice sheets.\",\"author\":\"crustaltrudger\",\"score\":328,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667141263,\"parent_id\":\"yhesgi\",\"link_id\":\"yhesgi\",\"retrieved_on\":1667855698,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iudj1np\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[deleted]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":2,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667141266,\"parent_id\":\"yhcktk\",\"link_id\":\"yhcktk\",\"retrieved_on\":1667855698,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iudo3jg\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"&gt; You would have to get into subatomic matter and such materials do not cluster in large enough masses to create an important obstruction.\\\\n\\\\nI suppose [Neutron Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star#Density_and_pressure) might reflect Gamma then?

That is, more of the visual field measured along the axis of sight will be in approximate focus the smaller the eyeball. This might sound like a desirable property, and in some cases it is. But it reduces your ability to determine target distance through adjusting the optical properties of the eye, for example by flexing the lens or adjusting the pupil diameter. When you focus on something in the nearfield or midfield, with a smaller depth of field you get more information about the relative position of a target and its visual background than you do with a larger depth of field. In the case of a pinhole aperture which has, in theory, unlimited depth of field, you get no information at all about the distance to any of the objects in the scene based on their relative sharpness because everything has the same sharpness. \\\\n\\\\nFor diurnal raptors, for example, a large depth of field isn't much of a disadvantage because they're trying to acquire relatively small targets which are relatively far away and are pretty much always just about the same distance away as their visual background. If you're looking at a rabbit from above you don't need to have optical information to know that the rabbit is just about as far away as the ground. On the other hand, if you are a diurnal ape operating along the surface of the Earth looking at the horizon, and your typical hunting targets are at most single to double-digit meters away when you begin your attack, and which is often hunting targets with complicated backgrounds at different distances away, it's pretty important to have the ability to distinguish how far away your target is in an absolute sense, as well as how far it is from its background. A larger eyeball, which, all other things being equal, gives you a smaller depth of field, helps in that aspect.\\\\n\\\\nIn general, our brain does quite sophisticated visual processing on the information it receives from our eyeballs. [In fact, the image processing is so sophisticated that it allows us to surpass the physics of our eyes in some sense under certain conditions.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacuity_(scientific_term\\\\\\\\)) Obviously we are not actually breaking physics with our eyes, but taking advantage of the fact that we have a matrix of receptors and combining the signal from more than just one to provide information at a finer resolution than would be possible if one simply naively took the intensity values recorded by each receptor and displayed them without processing. One could argue that perhaps shrinking the eyeball would free up some space in the cranium for more brain, but in order to maintain the same visual abilities one would probably need to devote more of the brain to visual processing.\",\"author\":\"coomb\",\"score\":6,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667155386,\"parent_id\":\"iuddzsu\",\"link_id\":\"yh2qzc\",\"retrieved_on\":1667854103,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iueaxzq\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Alzheimers is one of the great, frustrating failures of medical science.

It can only be zero if the wing is not generating lift.\\\\n\\\\nImagine a swept wing (actually, this applies to unswept wings as well) with Cl &gt; 0 at a specified but arbitrary angle of attack. The instant after it begins moving, some pressure field has developed, which, by stipulation (since we said the lift is positive), has higher pressure in at least some region below the wing than above the wing. Imagine we first confine our analysis to a 2d slice of the wing which is one of the areas the wing is currently generating lift; that is, there is higher integrated pressure on the lower surface of the wing than on the upper surface of the wing. Now consider the adjacent infinitesimal slice of the airfoil. Either its pressure distribution is exactly the same as its neighbor, in which case there will be no spanwise flow, or it is in some way different from its neighbor in which case there must be spanwise flow according to the pressure difference. Now, this reasoning applies to each slice of the wing moving outboard (or inboard for that matter) from the original slice that we stipulate is generating lift. But when we reach the wing tip, we have a physical discontinuity. In two adjacent slices, in one slice there is an airfoil and in another slice there is no airfoil at all. But the slice that has the airfoil has a high pressure region below the wing and a low pressure region above the wing (or one will develop shortly as the steady state is reached), while before the wing started moving, pressure was equal in the atmosphere immediately outboard of the wing tip. So we have, shortly after the the wing begins moving, a region at the wing tip where pressure is higher below the wing and lower above the wing. In order to accommodate that, it must be true that there is flow around the wingtip. That flow is driven by that pressure difference.\\\\n\\\\nBy this reasoning, for any finite wing generating lift, whether there is sweep or not, there must be spanwise flow. This spanwise flow is fundamentally driven by the requirement that pressure be continuous around the wing tip.\\\\n\\\\nThere are other ways to understand this, including by a number of mathematical theorems (including the Kutta-Joukowski theorem) which provide useful tools for calculating various aerodynamic quantities but, at least for me, don't really contribute to an intuitive understanding of the physics.\",\"author\":\"coomb\",\"score\":2,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667158259,\"parent_id\":\"ygzfn4\",\"link_id\":\"ygzfn4\",\"retrieved_on\":1667853769,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuepi9b\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Thank you for your submission!

This is due to the Siberian high. During the Ice Age, it would've been even less because precipitation as a whole dropped. In fact the whole region was too dry to even support forests and converted to a massive grassland.\\\\n\\\\nDuring periods where the summers in the northern hemisphere become cooler due to Milankovitch cycles, the amount of winter snow in northern North America and northern Europe was enough to slightly offset the amount melted during summer, leading to the buildup of snow/glaciers. Due to the albedo effect, it got too cold for significant melting even in summer and the area immediately south of the ice sheet experienced drops in temperature allowing ice to expand further.

It portrays a scenario in which a bad result happens because someone thinks an intervention will be harmful. It is a phenomenon that the field of medication safety occasionally overlooks. Nocebo is a derivative of the Latin word for \\\\\"to injure.\\\\\" Nocebo suggests that patients are more likely to encounter an unpleasant reaction to medication if they anticipate or are concerned about the adverse reaction. The negative effects are frequently clinically diagnosable and may be felt physically by the patient. The extreme negative impacts patients who were given a placebo during a clinical trial experienced are an illustration of the nocebo effect. Given that negative views are developed far more quickly than positive ones, some experts claim that the nocebo effect may have a greater impact on clinical outcomes than the placebo effect.\\\\r  \\\\n\\\\r  \\\\nThe nocebo effect might also have an impact on how patients react to generic drugs. When switching from an innovative \\\\\"branded\\\\\" product to a generic pharmaceutical, some patients may experience negative effects due to pre-existing cynicism about generic medications. It's crucial to keep in mind that nonverbal communication can sometimes cause a nocebo reaction. Nocebo effects seem to be more likely to occur in some patients. To prevent unintentionally starting the nocebo effect, women, people with anxiety or despair, people with a negative attitude, and people who are highly influenced by their environment may require extra attentive counseling. By achieving a proper balance between explaining both the beneficial and bad aspects of the treatment, as well as making sure the patient understands the treatment's logic, the danger of nocebo can be decreased.\",\"author\":\"joshuaisbrown\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667200260,\"parent_id\":\"y3xbur\",\"link_id\":\"y3xbur\",\"retrieved_on\":1667849982,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iugzzqz\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Thank you for your submission!

These work as well (e.g., in semiconductor production machines), but you will be restricted to a narrow band of wavelengths and incidence angles, and you may be restricted by the available materials. Not every wavelength you want to reflect may have materials available that have the appropriate indices of refraction.\",\"author\":\"phoboid\",\"score\":2,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667218137,\"parent_id\":\"yheipf\",\"link_id\":\"yheipf\",\"retrieved_on\":1667849004,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhlkdp\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"I seem to recall that hydrogen bombs use a \\\\\"fission-fusion-fission\\\\\" cycle to release much more fission energy.

The math for flexure is laid out in a variety of places, [Wickert, 2016](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf) provides a pretty complete view if you can't get your hands on a copy of [Turcotte &amp; Schubert](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/geodynamics/E0E847DA9FE68BDB90C2E457791F0C98#overview). Thus, you can calculate the predicted flexure for any mass, but in practice, that mass may be insufficient to produce a measurable flexure. The other big complication here is that the response also depends on the duration of the load and/or the rate of change of the load through time as the way the lithosphere responds to loads (i.e., purely elastic, viscoelastic, etc.) depends on the rate of change of the load (e.g., [Watts et al., 2013](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105457)).\\\\n\\\\n&gt; Also, does it depend on the makeup of earth that sits below said weight?\\\\n\\\\nYes. If you look through the math in Wickert, you'll see a few terms that potentially vary with location, specifically the density contrast between the infilling material and the mantle and the flexural rigidity (D). For the former, this means that the density of the load (i.e., is it rock, water ice, liquid water, etc) matters, but also that theoretically the density of the mantle in that location matters. In practice, we often assume a standard density for the mantle (not necessarily always) so we don't often consider this term to vary by location (but in reality, it might). However, flexural rigidity definitely does vary by location. If you go to the appendix, you'll see a definition for D that includes [Young's modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus), the [Poisson ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio), and the [effective elastic thickness (Te)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_elastic_thickness_of_the_lithosphere). We typically assume Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are constants for the lithosphere, but Te can vary a lot by location (e.g., [Watts, 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2117.1992.tb00043.x), [Burov &amp; Diament, 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB02770), [Burov, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817211001425)), e.g., the oceanic lithosphere generally has a narrow range of Te with most being ~10-20 km whereas continental lithosphere has a pretty wide range of Te with some in similar ranges as oceanic lithosphere but others being significantly thicker. The effective elastic thickness is kind of what the name implies, i.e., it's an approximation of the thickness of a purely elastic sheet that would explain the observed deflection for a given mass distribution. Te is generally not a physical thing (many of the cited papers are trying to find relations between Te and something we can actually measure like crustal thickness, temperature profiles, age, etc) but is something we estimate from observed deflections (though for oceanic lithosphere, it is more explainable as a function of lithosphere age/temperature). In general, for the same surface mass and mass distribution lower Te means more \\\\\"local compensation\\\\\", i.e., larger deflections with much shorter wavelengths, whereas larger Te means less deflection distributed over a much longer wavelength. In practice, Te is the main thing that we consider to vary as a function of location (and in turn, flexural ridigity) and this has a pretty important influence on how that area responds to a given load.\",\"author\":\"crustaltrudger\",\"score\":5,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667218223,\"parent_id\":\"iugjs74\",\"link_id\":\"yhesgi\",\"retrieved_on\":1667848997,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhlskb\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667218286,\"parent_id\":\"yi2ewa\",\"link_id\":\"yi2ewa\",\"retrieved_on\":1667848993,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhjykc\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"What about when all the continents were single?

Both fusion and fission weapons start with a conventional explosion; which forces a fission reaction to happen; that in turn ignites the fusion fuel causing fusion reaction. The only way this is achieved is by using a lot of explosives which compress the material enough the create the pressure required that the fission fuel can start undergoing fission reaction, you need to keep that going for long enough so that once the fusion fuel is compressed and heated it starts to undergo fusion. If the temperature or pressure drops - which go hand in hand in matter - both reactions will stop.\\\\n\\\\nSo what stops and infinite chain reaction? The fact that the explosion expands so much leading to drop in pressure. Drop in  pressure also leads to drop in temperature, since those two are tied. Temperature of something being just the amount of there is in a volume of space, if you compress something it \\\\\"heats up\\\\\" if you decompress something it \\\\\"cools down\\\\\" - in reality there is just same amount of energy but just in differ volume, temperature just being \\\\\"collisions\\\\\" against a boundary of this real or imaginary cube´. \\\\n\\\\nSo the problem with nuclear weapons is not the fission or fusion, but something more practical and which Americans were able to solve first and soviet's struggled with, namely using conventional explosives and timing those explosives in a way that the fission happens. The first nuclear weapons were \\\\\"gun type\\\\\" which as a term is more decriptive that you'd imagine. You shoot a ring of uranium to a uranium slug, with heavy carbide plates on both sides and really big explosions forcing it all together so the force is enough to keep the uranium in contact long enough to cause an explosion.  THis is incredibly inefficient process all things considered: Little boy managed to only burn 1,5% of it's fissile fuel; the most efficient fissile weapons raech only about 15% theoretical limiting being at best 25% - this is why they leave such massive fallouts; if these weapons were more efficient the fallout would be a less of an issue. Thermonuclear weapons however can reach efficiency of 50% in pratice and 80% in theory. The bigger the bomb is, the more efficient it is. However bigger the bomb is, the less practical it is as a weapon.

The synthesis of PGE2 begins with membrane phospholipids being converted to arachidonic acid (AA) by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). AA is then converted to PGH2 via cyclooxygenase (COX), after which PGH2 undergoes isomerization to PGE2 by PGE synthase. PGE2 acts via the EP3 receptor to affect specific neurons within the hypothalamus that aid in thermoregulation. Medications that inhibit COX are a mainstay of treatment for fevers, as it halts the conversion of AA into PGE2 and, thus, other prostanoids that can lead to fever.\\\\n\\\\nThe action of PGE2 begins when exogenous pyrogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses) stimulate endogenous pyrogens such as IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon (IFN) to alter the hypothalamic set point via the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and raise the core body temperature. Endogenous pyrogens also act to trigger an immune and inflammatory response. The immune response includes leukocytosis, T cell activation, B cell proliferation, NK cell killing, and increased white blood cell adhesion. The inflammatory response includes increased acute phase reactants, increased muscle protein breakdown, and increased synthesis of collagen.[4]\",\"author\":\"spidersandbeavers\",\"score\":14,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667223234,\"parent_id\":\"yi3t9o\",\"link_id\":\"yi3t9o\",\"retrieved_on\":1667848571,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhvbnh\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"So if the body is heating up to fight an infection are we not working against it by taking antipyretics?\",\"author\":\"fivedaysofpoop\",\"score\":27,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667223332,\"parent_id\":\"iuhr71e\",\"link_id\":\"yi3t9o\",\"retrieved_on\":1667848562,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhvebc\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667223367,\"parent_id\":\"iudj1fq\",\"link_id\":\"yhesgi\",\"retrieved_on\":1667848559,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iuhxb09\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Very informative and easy to understand, but the OP's question was entirely about this sentence, which you just glossed over without explanation:\\\\n\\\\\"This makes your body heat up, causing a fever.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes your body heat up?

Additionally, in most designs the radiation case is also constructed of a fissile material that undergoes fission driven by fast thermonuclear neutrons. Such bombs are classified as two stage weapons, and most current Teller–Ulam designs are such fission-fusion-fission weapons.

Kind of like a dog can sniff and follow a scent trail from a very faint signature, following the trail until it is eventually on top of the target. Immune cells like the one in the video (presumably a monocyte or macrophage) have receptors specifically designed for Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are molecules that are found on bacteria, fungi, viruses etc that our immune cells have evolved to recognize with receptors specific to them (antibodies not needed). An example of a PAMP is endotoxin/LPS that is a part of the bacterial cell wall. So for example, the bacteria sheds LPS or other pieces of its cell wall as it floats around, and the immune cell \\\\\"sniffs\\\\\" it out with its receptor and starts following the trail. \\\\n\\\\nIt gets more complex. There are hierarchical signals for what determines which direction an immune cell will migrate. For example, if local tissue cells realize there is an active ongoing infection, they will secrete \\\\\"red flag\\\\\" signals to recruit nearby immune cells to the area. These signals are called chemokines. So the immune cell floating around your blood will first detect the chemokines and realize something is wrong, and will enter the area where they are coming from.

However, in general, antibody binding to a molecule does not do really anything to the antigen, except occupy a space (which in itself can be useful). The constant region of the antibody will then interact with receptors on other immune cells (directly or indirectly). Different constant regions have different affinities for the different receptors on different immune cells. Broadly speaking, however, most of the mechanisms will result in local inflammation and targeted killing of the cell presenting the antigen.\\\\n\\\\nMore specifically for the case of a receptor, it would be incredibly hard to remove a receptor out of a membrane without damaging the cell. That said, there are definitely designed antibody based therapies where the constant region is specifically engineered for minimal interaction with immune cells and the antibodies act as blockers - taking up space on the receptor and interfering with ligand binding or with receptor multimerization or \\\\\"locking\\\\\" the receptor in a certain confirmation.

Or if the circulatory system is big enough that capillaries in one part of the body don’t have to experience the same fluctuations as another (provided no mechanical separation like a tourniquet or tumour or whatever)?\",\"author\":\"an711098\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667250032,\"parent_id\":\"iujc2s4\",\"link_id\":\"yi3t9o\",\"retrieved_on\":1667845577,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujoul3\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667250078,\"parent_id\":\"yhth1g\",\"link_id\":\"yhth1g\",\"retrieved_on\":1667845572,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujmxlw\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667249286,\"parent_id\":\"iuhtjma\",\"link_id\":\"yia9a5\",\"retrieved_on\":1667845660,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujnd42\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667249464,\"parent_id\":\"iui3lim\",\"link_id\":\"yia9a5\",\"retrieved_on\":1667845640,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujpxrf\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"[removed]\",\"author\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":1,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667250542,\"parent_id\":\"yhth1g\",\"link_id\":\"yhth1g\",\"retrieved_on\":1667845522,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujpzxf\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"Hi!

While the current plate configuration has one semi-continuous ocean basin that is partially rimmed by subduction zones (i.e., the \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\"), you could expect a later stage of a [supercontinent cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent_cycle) to have two ocean basins with some amount of subduction going on around their edges (though there are definitely some open questions here). I.e., at the moment, there is dominantly subduction happening around the Pacific, which is effectively the remnant of [Panthalassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa), i.e., the former exterior ocean surrounding Pangea, but assuming the next supercontinent forms via \\\\\"introversion\\\\\" (i.e., closure of the \\\\\"interior\\\\\" ocean basin, namely the Atlantic, to form the next supercontinent, see [Murphy &amp; Nance, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S167498711200103X) for additional information on extro- vs introversion in this context), then we would expect some period in the future where subduction (and volcanism) may still be occurring around some portion of the Pacific perimeter, but has also initiated around portions of the Atlantic. Ultimately though, there's generally the expectation of having one semi-continuous ring of subduction zones (i.e., the \\\\\"subduction girdle\\\\\") that reflects a particular style of large-scale mantle flow (i.e., \\\\\"degree 2 mantle flow\\\\\") that has two broad zones of upwelling (centered above antipodal [LLSVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_low-shear-velocity_provinces)) and then a circular girdle of downwelling, i.e., subduction, between them (e.g., [Mitchell et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00160-0)). Thus ultimately, assuming mantle convection, tectonics, and the supercontinent cycle works vaguely like it does on Earth, *we primarily expect there to be one \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\" that would be coincident with this subduction girdle feature*.\\\\n\\\\n&gt; How would it interact with the various species Carbon or nay?\\\\n\\\\nI don't know what you're asking here.\\\\n\\\\n&gt; And what happens if a planet has no Rings of Fire?\\\\n\\\\nIf we interpret this to mean that a planet has no active subduction zones and thus no active volcanic arcs, given that subduction is the primary driver of plate motion (e.g., see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/) on this subject), we would have to interpret this to mean that said planet did not have active plate tectonics, or at least did not have mobile lid tectonics in the same style as Earth. If we relax our definition of \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\" (and since it has no real formal definition, that's fine) to just mean that there are subduction zones, but not a configuration where one ocean basin is largely being consumed from all sides, again, this is potentially a viable part of the supercontinent cycle. I.e., there could be a period during future introversion where subduction has ceased around large swaths of the Pacific and at the same time, large-scale subduction of the Atlantic has not yet started around enough of the rim to be meet our arbitrary definition of the \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\". The feasibility of such a state really depends on how many subduction zones and how continuous they need to be to satisfy the condition of being, or not being, a \\\\\"Ring of Fire\\\\\". Ultimately, as described in the Mitchell et al. paper from above, the extent to which the \\\\\"subduction girdle\\\\\" and associated 2 degree mantle flow is a persistent feature or something that switches between that and 1 degree mantle flow (one zone of upwelling and one somewhat more concentrated zone of downwelling, i.e., subduction zones), with or without some potential intermediate behaviors, as part of the supercontinent cycle remains an open question, but would be relevant for understanding whether we expect for the \\\\\"subduction girdle\\\\\" to ever truly shut down.\",\"author\":\"crustaltrudger\",\"score\":32,\"gilded\":0,\"created_utc\":1667242482,\"parent_id\":\"yiizwf\",\"link_id\":\"yiizwf\",\"retrieved_on\":1667846430,\"controversiality\":0,\"is_submitter\":false}\n",",\n","{\"id\":\"iujyp9p\",\"subreddit\":\"askscience\",\"body\":\"40C (104F) is quite normal, specially in children.
