Whether its in our nature to kill is essentially an answered question, as certainly is not excluded from our nature/choices.

161,iqljyko,askscience,"The problem with this question is the normal atmospheric pressure bit. Without going to deep into the math, atmospheric pressure is directly proportional to the weight (mass • gravity) of the air above you. Varying the density - holding all other factors constant - means varying the mass, and thus the pressure it exerts. This is why you can comfortably sit at the bottom of miles of air, but swimming under the same depth of water would crush you, for instance.Its still an interesting question: but Im honestly not sure if its possible on a planetary scale without crushing pressures. Possibly if you varied the gravity of the planet, and thus both the weight, and the relative thickness of the atmosphere compared to surface density.In any case, to answer your underlying curiousity, I think wed have to allow for variance in some of the earth-like assumptions in your specific question. I doubt its possible with an atmosphere and pressure anything quite like Earth, but it might be possible in some alien environment which is still survivable to humans. Interesting thought anyway.ETA: One caveat that is important here is the question of whether you want us to be able to breathe. Free oxygen in such a dense fluid would tend to float up and be lost to space. A balloon filled with pure O2 would float, just like a helium balloon on Earth.

But a little bit is left in your trachea and other airways, so the next breath you inhale is actually a mix of fresh air, the air that’s left over in your lungs and the old air that’s remaining in your airways. That kind of dilutes the fresh air and adds more carbon dioxide to it. In a healthy person this isn’t a huge issue, but if you have COPD, the amount of air you can move each breath becomes smaller and smaller so you end up having trouble removing the old air from your lungs.

The orbital attraction of an object is purely defined by its mass, because its radius is really negligible over such large distances. This means that we can measure the mass of a black hole the same way we measure the mass of the sun and earth and every celestial body.

Eventually, if you add enough mass, the schwarzchild radius exceeds the actual radius and it collapses into a black hole.Adding mass to an object, even less dense mass, increases the schwarzchild radius. You would have to add increasingly less dense mass to an object to keep it from eventually forming a black hole, which is not generally going to happen in nature.Galaxies, as a whole, do not collapse into black holes because their schwarzchild radius is rather small due to the fact that they are almost entirely empty space. However, when galaxies collide, *parts* of them certainly do become dense enough to form black holes.Thus, no matter the object or its density, there is some amount of it that, if gathered together, will collapse into a black hole.

1211,iqrgb95,askscience,"&gt; Pardon my ignorance, but what is the point of measuring a black holes density by taking the volume inside the event horizon? The formation condition for a simple black hole is essentially that you fit enough mass inside of the corresponding Schwarzschild radius (i.e. within the event horizon). This is, in effect, the critical density an object of a given mass must match/exceed in order to form a black hole. &gt; The black hole itself is the singularity, which is where the whole infinite density thing comes from, and of course before and during the collapse the volume of the pre-bh body matters, but after its already become a black hole why do we care about its mass divided by the Schwarzchild radius?A black hole is a region of spacetime within which no outgoing null geodesics can reach infinity - i.e. its a region that light cannot escape from, meaning that a black hole is the region bounded by the event horizon. According to general relativity a black hole might *contain* a singularity, but it is not true to say that a black hole *is* a singularity or even strictly *requires* a singularity. Between the point of initial formation of a black hole (e.g. from a star) and the point at which the matter would be expected to collapse to a singulartity, the black hole is still a black hole. &gt; Also, I did not say that there are no black holes less dense than an apple. I said that an apples density isnt enough to *form* a black hole. Once one is formed, I never really stopped to think about its density varying. Especially in light of the question I just asked you. These statements are equivalent. In line with my first answer in this comment, a sufficiently large object with the density of an apple *would* instantaneously form a black hole, before it ever began to collapse. This is not about the idea of a black hole forming and then later decreasing in density, theres no fundamental requirement that a black hole begin with any particular density, provided it has sufficient mass. &gt; So idk if a black hole could form at a higher density than an apple but somehow lose mass without the event horizon shrinking proportionally, but if it could, then both of us would be right.You seem to have misunderstood the relationship Im describing. **Bigger, heavier** black holes are **less dense**. A black hole would not need to lose mass to decrease in density, in fact it would have the opposite effect. As I say, this isnt about a black hole somehow gaining the density of an apple via a loophole, so this is irrelevant. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject, but it is *very* clear that you are not familiar with how black holes behave, and it is frustrating then that you would attempt to explain them to other people anyway - what you have directly stated as fact is actively misinforming people.

Because thats the key which even the theoretical physics academics, the cosmology academics, and the mathematicians have been stuck on practically since Chandrasekhar proved that GR does not yield curvature solutions when enough mass/energy is packed into a volume smaller than the Schwarzchild Radius. (Im leaping forward there, but thats where his work led not too far down the road.) Mathematicians loathe singularity solutions, because in the world where math operates singularities mean someone screwed up (and thats probably the person who worked up the equations in the first place). Anytime you begin with a multivariate problem and the end result is that one or more of those variables = +/- ∞ something very not right has happened. This is especially frustrating because to all parties involved these are *real world* solutions where (as far as we know) most types of infinities dont exist (entirety of the cosmos notwithstanding). Its a very reasonable point of view as well, honestly. But the most important thing for anyone to realize is how much work, how many painstaking bits of data, and the level of obsession has been involved in *proving GR is correct* over the last ~ 100 years. GR has been worked out for tens of thousands of real-world measurements, and Im probably understating the real number by at least one order of magntude. The maths of GR have been proven to be almost unnaturally correct every time. Theres not been the slightest chink in the armor for more than a century. General Relativity feels like Einstein didnt just create some equations which describe reality... but rather that he intuitively stumbled upon one of the fundamental, bedrock truths of the cosmos. At this point arguing that the singularity solutions dont make sense seems truly silly, and pointing to the absence of direct evidence (conveniently locked away in a place we probably will never be able to obtain real data from) almost feels disingenuous. It is perfectly acceptable to look at event horizons as the means by which the cosmos tucks away things which have violated things like the Bekenstein Boundary. The horizon then is easily described mathematically as a surface of last reflection where everything that is inside(which makes no sense mathematically) or ever falls in eventually scatters off the surface on timescales so large as to be *beyond* mere incomprehensibility. Thats a perfectly valid working model which totally ignores the infinite spacetime curvature on the other side of the horizon, and only deals with the horizon.

Keep in mind, this is a theory so we aren’t absolutely certain this is true, but assuming it is true has led to many incredible discoveries in QM which indirectly led to more support for this theory. In simpler terms, it’s basically true but might not be the full picture, in the same way that Relativity is exactly that. Stephen Hawking became famous for discovering Hawking Radiation, or that black holes will slowly and randomly radiate away particles from their total mass. This is a gross oversimplification, but the easiest way I can think to explain it is: the universe is actually not a vacuum at all; particles and antiparticles constantly pop into existence and annihilate each other. This happens due to tiny fluctuations in quantum fields and energy in the area. Black holes radiate quantum energy constantly, and the net energy change is usually 0 because the particles “borrow” energy, then instantly “return it” when they destroy each other. However, if the particles are created on the actual event horizon itself, there is a chance that one of the particles enters the black hole and the other does not. The result of this is that the black hole will lose an incredibly small amount of mass (to “pay back” the energy “debt”) from this event, since both particles were originally part of the total black hole mass. This is not actually the TRUE explanation of why and how this happens, but it’s close enough to understand it conceptually without digging a lot deeper into the nitty gritty of everything.

1646,iqt6ye0,askscience,"I don’t know what you mean by “megafauna back then may have been pseudo-warm blooded”, partly because I don’t know what “pseudo-warm blooded” means. For the most part, an animal is either endothermic, or it isn’t (unless you’re talking about a few special cases like bumblebees, which use movement to raise their temperature sometimes, but are overall still ectothermic, but this is only really a thing in a few small invertebrates to my knowledge). Dinosaurs are believed to have all been endothermic, although like their modern bird descendants, they probably did have lower body temperatures on average than most mammals. But if you’re talking about past mammalian megafauna (or even present to some degree), the suggestion that they may have not been truly endothermic seems pretty baseless, as the range of average body temperatures in living mammals doesn’t really correlate with size very much (in that there are both examples of large and small animals with relatively high temperatures, and large and small with relatively low temperatures), really, adaptations to different climates and other physiological factors are much more important, and larger animals with high body temperatures require a more energy-rich diet to sustain the metabolic requirements, but to my knowledge that’s the main limitation. And *all* living mammals are true endotherms that generate body heat metabolically, even if there is some variance there. Whales are true endotherms, and as far as we can tell, blue whales are actually the biggest animals in general have ever gotten (at least in terms of mass). A much bigger constraint on size is gravity (which is why aquatic animals have always grown the largest), followed by pulmonary efficiency (essentially, it takes special physiology to ensure that oxygenated blood can reach all the tissues it needs to in a big animal, and again, gravity is also a factor here when an animal is terrestrial, which is why it’s thought that the complex bird-like respiratory systems of dinosaurs may have played a role in them getting so big on land, in addition to the higher oxygen content of the atmosphere during the Mesozoic). While terrestrial mammals never got as big as dinosaurs, they did once get *a lot* bigger than African elephants do today, such as the gigantic rhinoceros *Indricotherium*, and there’s absolutely no reason to believe any of these animals weren’t true endotherms (we obviously can’t know from fossils exactly how their body temperature stacked up to their smaller living relatives, but again, it’s not likely to have been nearly as important factor as many other things).EDIT: also, as someone pointed out above, getting really big is actually in some respects *harder* for ectotherms, as it takes longer to warm a very large body in the sun, so they need to spend far more time basking the bigger they get. This is part of why cold-blooded giant dinosaurs were initially criticized as a theory, because a cold-blooded *Tyrannosaurus*, for instance, would literally waste all its time soaking up heat from the sun rather than hunting, and would just be far too plodding and sluggish to be an efficient apex predator.EDIT 2: my bad, it seems that there are also some fish with a physiological means of generating some of their own heat, to the point of sometimes being referred to as “endothermic” informally, but they do so through different means than birds/dinosaurs or mammals do, and this also still doesn’t relate to any past land megafauna.",regular_modern_girl,6,0,1664749335,iqs8tjv,xtuh86,1668004294,0,False,0.7372913360595703,0.68337876,bluetoothxiii

1677,iqtgbe9,askscience,"&gt; Its probability. There are thousands, millions, maybe infinite different tangled states a cord can be in, and exactly one non tangled stateThis can not possibly be true. Or rather I feel youre conflating topology (does or doesnt contain a knot) with physical pose (the real physical position of a string). Consider protein folding. No protein forms true knots when they fold but we know there are [nearly] infinitely large number of states any non-trivial protein chain can adopt. And so it must be with regards pieces of string; there are surely an infinite number of unknotted poses a string can adopt and an infinite number of poses which also contain knots.So yes there is only one topology that has no knots (by definition of the problem) but a string with that topology can still explore nearly infinite numbers of physical states. And this is somewhat reflected in the paper youve linked. In their tumbling experiment their string only knots about 33% of the time.

1887,iqub47l,askscience,"I think it depends on a lot of factors. In general, I believe that adipose tissue (fat) retains heat better than a lot of other tissues, so I think it depends somewhat on an organism’s bodily composition. For ectotherms, they do need circulation to distribute warmth around to all their tissues, and a bigger body means that process naturally is going to take somewhat longer. This is part of why crocodiles (which in many cases are *really* big animals) are all in aquatic sit-and-wait predatory niches in their surviving forms, as they can be huge but still relatively sluggish and spend a lot of time basking, because they just need enough energy to strike out hard when the moment is right, they don’t need to pursue prey, etc. There used to be fully-terrestrial predatory lineages of crocodilians, but they were in general not quite as big and were built very differently, being generally lean and long-legged for pursuing land-based prey (they were probably a lot like big monitor lizards like Komodo dragons in terms of the niche they occupied and how they hunted, and they were probably similarly limited to being diurnal hunters in hot climates). Like I know that, at least for big predatory dinosaurs, the assumption that they were ectothermic like living reptiles was long a source of confusion, to the point where (prior to the theory that dinosaurs were probably mostly or entirely warm-blooded) a number of paleontologists forwarded the idea that dinosaurs like *T. rex* were more likely scavengers than active hunters, because it was just too hard to imagine them being able to relentlessly pursue prey with that kind of bulk if they were cold-blooded.Clearly, it isn’t a complete barrier against getting really big, as plenty of very large presumably cold-blooded creatures have existed over time (like I believe that most Mesozoic marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs are assumed to have been ectotherms, since they came from older diapsid lineages that hadn’t evolved endothermy—in fact, mosasaurs seem to have literally been gigantic marine lizards, related to monitors—and they were still able to get pretty massive in some cases, although still not quite as big as the largest whales), but I also think it probably indicates something that the very *biggest* of animals to ever live all seem to have been warm-blooded, and that’s definitely not that endothermy itself is a barrier to great size, quite the opposite in fact.",regular_modern_girl,1,0,1664767751,iqtz78j,xtuh86,1668003032,0,False,0.8521086573600769,0.6434624,responsiblead2541

1938,iquj09w,askscience,"&gt;Well it comes to the theories themselves I understand they have certain eV ranges. Are these ranges gigantic ?The gap between the electroweak and GUT scales is pretty gigantic.  As for theories of new physics between them, it depends on the theory.  Some have narrower constraints on their possible ranges than others.&gt;It still seems to suggest that the possible eV Range of detections of what I assume is either branes or some kind of extra dimensions goes all the way from 3TeV which is what apparently we have checked so far goes possibly up to the GUT scale itself.Yes, my understanding is that colliders like the LHC can only raise the lower limit on the energy scale (or equivalently, lower the upper limit on the length scale) at which any small extra dimensions could become apparent, but since there isnt really any way to place an upper limit I am aware of, the range of possibilities is quite large.&gt;Does that mean unless we build some kind of Gigantic particle collider that is somehow the distance of Earth to Mars. We may very well never reach these scales for possibly centuries?Essentially, yes.  We can keep making incremental improvements — perhaps even a few substantial leaps — but speaking frankly a lot of the hypothetical higher-energy phenomena that is closer to the GUT scale are likely to be practically inaccessible to us for ... well, probably more than just centuries.  Personally I place the likelihood that human civilization peaks and wanes to be greater than the likelihood that we ever make it far enough to test any physics that might lie near the GUT scale.&gt;Can you observe certain phenomenon at those scales with telescopes from some mechanism.Only if you can find a natural system out there in the cosmos which both exhibits those phenomena and is observable with a telescope.  Some important high-energy phenomena, such as those at the surface of a neutron star, might become observable (but also with some very dramatic improvements in telescope capacities).  But its not like we could point a telescope and see things like individual particles out there in space, especially not high-energy particles that nearly instantly decay after being produced.  That might happen in, say, a supernova event, but imagining the feat of engineering it would take to make such tiny and precise measurements in the vicinity of a supernova without being obliterated ... its probably much simpler to just create any such particles in a laboratory on or near Earth, even if it does take up such an enormous amount of energy to access.&gt;I’m sorry if I’m asking a billion questions this stuff is just amazing to me.Nah, no worries, it is good that you are curious! :)  You are asking good and thoughtful questions; keep em coming if you like!Cheers,",forte2718,3,0,1664772434,iqu2gdd,xttqf1,1668002789,0,False,0.8902570605278015,0.71628416,dabbing_squid

The underlying idea is that our ancestors were colonised by many helminths and other gut parasites which on the one hand caused a major health burden, but on the other hand may have served as sparring partners for our immune system and to co-regulate the microbiome somehow. Some people indeed suggest that the living conditions in Western societies are too hygienic and that we have lost many of our old friends over time, both among bacteria and among eukaryotic symbionts like helmniths. As a consequence, some suggest that re-introducing them in a controlled manner could help with all kinds of gut diseases, in particular regarding a control of inflammation reactions.One therapeutic approach that has been suggested is the use of helminth eggs from species that do not usually infect humans, but rather other closely related hosts (e.g, primates or pigs). Those would then not be able to fully develop in a human host, but a hatching helminth could still elicit the desired immune regulatory responses before being excreted. As I said, this is beyond my expertise, so Im not sure what the most recent state of trials in humans is; I am aware of work in animal models mostly.To my knowledge, the big caveat with these trials has been that while healthy individuals respond well and helminth eggs indeed could provide some protection, those that already had an inflamed gut sometimes actually experienced an exacerbation upon ingesting the helminths.

Importantly, these reports do **not** mean that an unhealty GI tract has a causative role in the development of autism (remember, correlation is not the same as causation). Instead, I think it is also plausible that people with autism have GI symptoms for other reasons (think diet, hand/oral hygiene, etc) which are alleviated by FMT.

3279,ir1cwiv,askscience,"Thanks for the interesting question!The idea that bacteria in your gut might influence the way you think (and if or if not you develop a mental illness) is both fascinating and terrifying. The link between the gut and the brain (the so-called gut-brain axis) is fairly well established, and naturally people have tried to include gut microbes into this equation. There are numerous studies reporting that people with mental illnesses have a different microbiome, and anecdotal evidence that FMT can alleviate some of the symptoms associated with those (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xvc1gb/comment/ir191v1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xvc1gb/comment/ir191v1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))That being said, most of the conclusions in this field stem from experiments done on model organisms, typically lab mice. While lab mice are fairly intelligent, many of the mouse models of mental illness are controversial. Simply put, some researchers dont believe that a mouse can be depressed or have borderline personality disorder in the same way that a human can have. So drawing meaningful conclusions from these studies is tricky. At the same time, it isextremely hard or downright impossible to perform an experimental study on humans in the context of mental illness because of ethical dilemmas. Finally, in a young and competetitve research area that moves as fast as this one, good and bad studies are released alongside each other in high frequencies and it typically takes time for studies to be repeated and for scientists to become 100% confident in the conclusions we draw from the data.I believe that gut microbes naturally influence and interact with the human gut in many different ways.

Can be rectal (colonoscopy or retention enema), nasal (via a tube into the GI tract) or oral (capsules containing prepared material that is released in the intestine).&amp;#x200B;&gt;How do you check for the viability of the transplant?There are certain steps to prepare stool before transplantation, and these are usually done under anaerobic conditions if possible, to preserve oxygen-sensitive commensals.

If frozen stool samples are used, they are thawed and prepared in such a way to preserve viability as much as possible.&amp;#x200B;&gt;Are there any species that cannot survive the transplant (due to maybe very strict anaerobic requirements or pH tolerance)?Interestingly, we didnt observe any species where donor strains never made it into the recipient (and neither any where donor strains were always able to colonise).

Is there something specific in diets that makes you more likely to be a good doner?I think that the idea of a vegan supermicrobiome was very hot in the field for some time but has mostly been debunked. One of our more surprising findings has been that the donors microbiome generally seems to matter less for microbiome-level FMT outcomes than the recipients microbiome state. That said, vegans are generally more likely to have a healthy and more considerate lifestyle, but like everyone else, they can still carry pathogens or bad bugs that dont make them sick (because their immune system or their commensal microbiome keep them in check) but which could have detrimental effects on an FMT recipient. Therefore donor screening usually focusses on pathogens and the like, sometimes with additional health-related parameters. I think there have been a few trials specifically recruiting vegan donors, but I am not aware of vegans having higher success rates.&amp;#x200B;&gt;Why cant a good diet alone change things. What does stool in particular do?The effect of diet on the microbiome is generally less pronounced than many people think. But with some diseases, its probably more like being stuck in an unfavourable microbiome state that it takes more than a little nudge to get out of. Most interventions are either negative – antibiotics try to get rid of undesired bugs, bowel cleansing flushes and perturbs the entire system – or involve probiotic strains that may not have the desired effect in the recipient at all. Stool transplants are certainly a complex intervention, but the idea is to both perturb and overwhelm the recipients microbiome while hoping that some bugs will stick around and help navigate the microbiome out of that stuck corner. In practice its all more complicated, but I suppose this is the general idea.&amp;#x200B;&gt;What practical implications do you think will come from your research?None our studies was in a position to make actionable proposals. But I think that our findings will help guide the design of future trials, in particular because we point out which of the many, many parameters in the process are relevant to tune and which arent. In the longer run, works like ours may help towards the design towards more personalised interventions (not entire stools, but maybe tailor-made probiotics cocktails for every recipient - that has been a goal in the field for a long time).&amp;#x200B;&gt;Do you know anything about if stool transplant affect mental health?No I dont, though its a relevant question.

Following an FMT, one will usually find that some recipient strains managed to stick around, that some donor strains managed to successfully colonise and that – rather interestingly – some new strains that werent observed in either donor or recipient beforehand also pop up (they were probably too lowly abundant before the intervention). Interestingly, however, the dynamic window after the intervention is mostly the first week, up to the first four weeks. After that, the composition is relatively stable again – some studies have followed up recipients for up to two years.That said, several diseases for which FMTs have been trialled are characterised by a generally unstable microbiome that is less resilient to changes in the first place – like IBD, IBS or recurrent C. diff infection.

3824,ir4hvsg,askscience,"Hi!Before answering your question, I first want to point out that none of the four of us leading the studies referenced above is a clinical practitioner, so we have never conducted an FMT or designed a clinical trial into FMTs. We are (computational) biologists who have analysed microbiome sequencing data from FMT trials with a specific focus on microbiome dynamics following FMT. So we did not primarily look at clinical readouts, and neither did we focus on specific indications (we were all looking for common trends shared between very different indications).That said, I think that there are two parts to answering your question. First, the purported association between autism and the microbiome has always been a mere correlation, but (in my opinion) there is no convincing data to support a causal role for the microbiome. In other words, I am sceptical of claims that the microbiome contributes to or causes autism in children. Indeed, even the previously observed associations (differences in microbiome composition between autistic and healthy people) seem to have been confounded and were recently debunked in a very thorough study: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34767757/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34767757/) In that, Yap et al showed (very convincingly imo) that autistic microbiome signatures were actually due to autism-related dietary preferences – so the microbiome is different because autistic children tend to have a more restricted diet than their healthy counterparts. To be honest, to me that makes much more sense than the claim that microbiome shifts during early life are a cause of autism in children.On the other hand, microbiome-targeting interventions (like FMT) seem to alleviate autism symptoms in some cases. Much work has been done in mouse models (where there exists the additional complication that it is difficult to reproduce the complex human behavioural patterns of autism in a rodent), but there have also been trials in human children. Again, I am not a clinician and was never involved in an autism-related trial for FMT; but my strong impression is that indeed, the drive is to alleviate symptoms and to improve quality of life. If this is doable with a microbiome-targeting intervention during early life somehow, I suppose it would be a major step forward. However, it is much too early to tell whether this will actually work out in the future.",tsbschm,1,0,1664956196,ir3shzh,xvc1gb,1667991910,0,False,-0.0272503197193145,0.49248976,yesimevil

But until then, the donor stool method will be around for a bit longer. FMT with your own stool (referred to as autologous FMT) could be an alternative, but there are some logistical and technical challenges with long-term storage.

In detail, this is really only relevant for what we would call the [basement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basement_%28geology%29). As described in [some detail, and relatively simply here](https://fdep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=992bf1a70b734dbea8487aabb6ed5bee), during the assembly of Pangea, the rocks that would eventually become the basement of modern day Florida were part of [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana) that collided with Laurentia (basically North America). The same could be said for the basement of pretty much any rocks to the east of the modern day Appalachian mountains. When Pangea rifted apart, the rifting did not follow the previous suture location exactly, but was broadly a bit to the (modern day) east of it, so portions of what use to be Gondwana ended up remaining sutured to Laurentia/North America. However, (and as well explained in the Florida Geology link from above) all of the rocks that make up Florida today represent shallow water deposition *well after* this rifting event (so in geology parlance, we would not consider these rocks to have Gondwanan affinity, though if there were exposures of the basement, we could describe it as such). Similarly, much of the relevant geologic history that helps to explain why Florida is above sea level is related to glacial-interglacial sea level changes, but its not the only relevant bit (e.g., the late Cenozoic topographic rejuvenation of the Appalachians plays a role as well). This is an important clarification as the original description made it sound like the rocks that make up the modern surface of Florida existed at the time that the basement was a part of Africa (which itself was a part of Gondwana).",crustaltrudger,37,0,1664966227,ir4b0hs,xw1j0n,1667991566,0,False,0.9518426060676576,0.7097553,vlaxdrek

Increased cellular metabolism requires more oxygen to sustain it.  Oxygen is delivered by bloodflow.So, if youre using a part of your brain a whole lot, that part of your brain is going to generate more CO2.  That increase in CO2 is going to trigger more bloodflow to that region of the brain, delivering more oxygen and metabolic substrates to support that increased metabolic activity.  If CO2 starts to drop in a region of the brain, this is a signal that there isnt a lot of metabolic activity, so there is less need for oxygen/substrates, so blood flow reduces to that area.  This same idea can be expanded to the whole brain, whereby if you hyperventilate and lower arterial CO2 values, then each region of your brain independently goes Oh, Co2 is low, there must not be a lot of activity here, I dont need as much blood or oxygen.  When your whole brain does that, you pass out due to the reduction in brain blood flow.So, pH isnt involved.  Additionally, you have this whole system of pH buffering, primarily by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase which catalyzes the conversion of CO2 into H2CO3.  Its extremely effective at stabilizing pH.

But there is clear evidence that organisms capable of digesting cellulose existed before the Caboniferous, and there is even some evidence of lignin decay. Tectonic and climatic conditions were probably much mroe important factors in the age of coal.Lignin decomposing fungi also require oxygen, so an anoxic swamp prevents/slows complete decay.There is still a lot of younger coal from the Mesozoic Era (age of reptiles/dinosaurs) and coal has continued to form up to geologically recent times, all long after lignin decomposing fungi evolved.

5795,ireh74k,askscience,"The way it was taught to me that I still believe is a very simple way to visualize it is that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the displaced water. That water is trying to rush back in and fill that space, but it needs to push the object up to do so.Meanwhile, in the other direction, for a rigid object, it has a weight of its own that is applied in the opposite direction, fighting the buoyant force.So your calculation at any time for whether the object floats is literally just: does the volume of water displaced by the object weigh more that the total weight of the object itself?As the water level rises, the volume of displaced water increases until (for an object of lower overall density than water) the weight of the displaced water is eventually greater than the weight of the object and it begins to float.Only now does the weight distribution of your object begin to come into effect. To figure out if a floating object rotates, you compare the center of mass (the spot inside the object where the average mass in all directions is equal) to the center of volume of displaced water (the spot inside the area where object is displacing water where the average volume in all directions is equal). The weight of the object is applied downwards at the location of the center of mass and the buoyant force is applied upwards at the location of the center of volume of displaced water. If these two vectors dont line up, you get a rotation. The object will attempt to rotate until both vectors line up (the heavy side is on the bottom) or, the edges of the object collide with the ground. However, it should be noted that the volume of displaced water will not change during this rotation, since its weight and the weight of the displaced water are currently in equilibrium (and always will be as long as the object is floating). The edge of the object may drag, preventing the object from rotating freely or drifting laterally until the water level rises high enough that the edge of the object can clear the floor while rotating, but it can still be considered floating at any point in this thought exercise where the volume of displaced water exceeds the weight of the object, even if it cant rotate.To give a more precise (calculus) answer, you could consider every vertical slice of the object from end to end and find that for an object with an uneven weight distribution, there will appear to be a point where the light side is trying to float and the heavy side is still sinking. This, I think, is where we get this intuition that unevenly weighted objects must take more water to begin floating. But when you do the math, youll find that this partial floating state occurs before the volume of displaced water weighs as much as the object anyways.Edit: spelling",jesusbeardo,28,0,1665149078,irdeqsf,xxp5gu,1667981361,0,False,0.941944420337677,0.5220166,solenyapdx

That probability cloud might look in a certain way depending on its environment. An electron that is bound in an atom will remain bound there until it is kicked away, but its actual position around the atom is best described as a probability cloud that is denser in some places and less dense in others. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, this probability cloud *is* the particle. It is not merely a descriptor of where the true particle is located, because there is no true particle beyond the probability cloud. If the probability cloud then interacts strongly with something else, it will collapse, meaning that it suddenly becomes sharp and well-defined at a single spot with a single momentum - the cloud becomes a point, which will then immediately start spreading out again as a cloud, until you measure it next time. The collapse is truly random, but obviously you have a much higher chance to measure the particle in a spot where the probability cloud is denser.The Copenhagen Interpretation is not the only interpretation, and there are many scientists that dislike it. However, this proof that the universe is not locally real does strengthen the Copenhagen Interpretation somewhat, but I dont have enough expertise to say how much exactly.

6249,irewov0,askscience,"Actually, Ive been thinking about this a bit more and I think I maybe didnt do a good job answering the actual question. First of all, for your specific example of the two objects, identical except for their weight distribution, Id say the object that has the lower center of mass is actually going to lift off first, if we only consider the object to have lifted-off when it is no longer touching the ground at all, for the simple fact that the low center of mass is going to stabilize it and cause it not to rotate. This is one of the main ways boats are kept from capsizing; they typically have heavy engines or ballast kept at the bottom of the boat for stability ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballast ).The object with the high center of mass will technically not flip if it manages to stay balanced (this is how rockets are able to go to space - their engines act as a sort of buoyant force, the vector for which is lined up exactly with the weight vector of the rest of the rocket), however, realistically, in rising flood waters, the object is unlikely to remain perfectly balanced, and only a slight bump is necessary to cause it to begin rotating when its already floating, and it will very quickly fall out of equilibrium and try to rotate its heavy side down.For the more interesting case where you have an object which does not already have its center of mass lined up with center of the volume of displaced water though, I think I underplayed the role of the normal force a bit. When the object gets into a state where part of it is trying to float but part of it is still touching the ground, the part that is still touching the ground is contributing to the forces counter-acting the weight of the object, so less volume of water is needed to keep the rest of the object afloat.Consider a contrived example with a hypothetical boat cube that has an edge length of E and a total density of half of that of water, so the weight of a cube of water with volume E-cubed (the same volume as the hypothetical boat cube) is double the weight of the boat cube, so the boat cube floats when exactly half of it is underwater. Now imagine that the boat cube is massless except for a single point which contains all its mass. If this point is in the middle of one of its square faces, the cube can float freely as soon as the water level reaches E/2 (plus some infinitesimally small additional distance to actually lift it off the surface of the ground). If, on the other hand, you put the entire mass of the cube in the middle of one of its edges, when the water level reaches E/2, the entire mass of the cube is still on the ground. Most of the cube is floating but the entire mass of the cube is still anchoring the edge of the cube in place, the normal force is not 100% the weight of the cube, because it is displacing some water, but its not 0% either, because its not yet displacing E-cubed/2 water, because its on an angle. However, when the water level reaches square-root((E/2)-squared + (E/2)-squared) (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem ) finally exactly half the cube is underwater and 0% of its weight is supported by the normal force and it can be considered floating.So Id say technically, as long as the weight of the object is offset by the weight of the volume of the water displaced, an object will float, in practice, if the object is oddly shaped or has an odd distribution of mass, the level of water required for this equilibrium state to be reached can vary even for two objects with the exact same overall weight.",jesusbeardo,7,0,1665156412,ireh74k,xxp5gu,1667980904,0,False,0.9999999403953552,0.62829316,jesusbeardo

This is known as the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem).The tragedy of quantum mechanics is, that while the formalism works spectacularly well to *predict* the outcome of experiments in a statistical manner, it does nothing to *explain* what is going on. General Relativity, for example, is a theory that both gives us tools to predict the outcome of experiments, *as well as a way to interoperate it*. Quantum mechanics is not as cooperative, unfortunately, which is why we have [a plethora of interpretations of the formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).  That being said, the Copenhagen interpretation solves your question by noting that the collapse of the wave function does not transmit *information*. While Alices measurement forces Bobs particle into a well-defined state, there is no way for Bob to *know* that.

Then you take one without seeing it and I take the other without seeing it. Later, when you look at your marble and see it’s white, you know that mine is black. No information passed between the marbles, we just know that if one is black the other is white. You could consider those properties ‘entangled’, revealing one also determines the other. Now, marbles are a macro scale object. Even if you didn’t see it, your marble was white all along. Looking at it didn’t matter. For a long time, that’s what we thought of quantum particles as well. We might not know the property of a particle until we measure it, but it still had that property and measuring it just reveals it. Turns out, that isn’t so. A quantum marble is neither black nor white until something ‘measures’ it, which means it interacts with something that needs to know if it’s black or white. Only at that point, is it determined which it is and, even though we separated the marbles hours ago, for a quantum marble it can always be either until measured. It’s not just a case of our not knowing, it really exists as a ‘superposition’ of both black and white up until it needs to be one or the other.Let’s go a little further. I gave you a quantum marble and kept the other one. If one is black, the other must be white. They also have other properties, like both being round and smooth, etc, which are identical. These are quantum marbles, so they both exist as a superposition of black and white right now. You go down the street and come to a door that will let anyone with a marble through. You pass through because you have a marble, but that doesn’t ‘collapse’ the marble into one color. You come to another door that will let anyone through with a square marble. You cannot go through, your marble is round. This does not measure if the marble is black or white, so it’s still in a superposition. You come to a final door that let’s through only people holding a black marble. You then have to reveal your marble and either it is black or white. There’s a 50% chance it will be black and you can pass through. This is how an object is said to be observed or measured. When you reveal your marble like this, we also know what color my marble is, even though nobody looked at it and nothing measured it. How does my marble know when your marble collapses into being black or white? That’s the question that’s being answered.

It’s just that if Alice and Bob subsequently compare their measurements, we will always see that both measurements are consistent with the initial quantum state.Many physicists note that it’s equally valid to say that upon making a spin measurement, Alice and Bob can each be described as being in a superposition of states (Alice+up, Alice+down), and (Bob+down, Bob+up). Quantum mechanics says nothing about where one might choose to place the “observer” - in theory one might say that every interaction between two quantum states creates a third quantum state that is the product of the first two, and that one might apply this recursively for every chain of events back to history. Quantum computers rely on this to build exceedingly complicated chains of quantum states. One must still explain why, when Alice and Bob compare their results, they agree that they either got (Alice+up,Bob+down) or vice versa. All that our current math can state is that wherever you choose to denote an interaction as an “observation”, the wave function will provide the probabilities of what is “observed”. The rest is literally unknown, unsolved metaphysics.The many worlds interpretation would suggest that both histories (Alice+up, Bob+down) AND (Alice+down, Bob+up) are just as real as each other and evolve independently as separate universes. The Copenhagen Interpretation kind of just says that the wave function collapses into one of the states as soon as it is “observed” based on some choice of observer.

You cant indirectly observe things like you theorized because the act of measurement requires interacting with the (quantum) object.  For example, we see things because photons bounce off them and into our eyes. In the quantum world, because things are so small, trying to see something by bouncing a photon (more likely an electron) off it changes the state of the object being observed because the photon imparts a significant amount of energy into it. Because we need to use that photon to see, theres no way to tell what the object was like before the measurement.Edit: Actually this is debatable.  Under some interpretations, observers are really just measurement devices.  However, some other theories consider consciousness integral, because we dont know if the device really measured anything until we checked.

Nicotine (from tabacco) works on one type, while muscarine (from a mushroom) works on the other type, showing that they have different shapes and modes of action. This way, you dont need an in-depth knowledge of their structure to distinguish between them.Later, scientists found out that the nicotinic receptor is a channel receptor that directly affects neuron firing, while the muscarinic receptor is a surface receptor that sets off a bunch of internal changes in the neuron.

Birds, interestingly, cannot taste capsaicin, but to mammals it causes a burning sensation in the mouth, ensuring that the mammals will mostly avoid it but the birds will eat it happily.With THC and psilocybin, the theory is that the compounds cause confusion, dissuading predators from returning.It’s fascinating how the evolutionary script can get flipped sometimes: in the case of both cannabis and chili peppers, an attribute they evolved originally to repel mammals, the trait eventually appealed to humans who started cultivating them for it, and now they are two of the most widespread and successful plant species in the history of the planet.",c4terw4l,2250,0,1665244848,irixxoe,xytmhk,1667976616,0,False,0.9030851125717164,0.4271739,sharksandwich81

(burning a load of dried leaf and flower waste in a tent to get a fire started is going to get you stoned) After which the plants that provided all three resources may have been selectively cultivated. What we Know today as sinsemilla (sp) did not exist. Today female plants are permitted to grow to maturity while male plants are removed and destroyed to prevent accidental pollination of commercial drug crops, that was not the case originally.Male plants are naturally taller than female plants to aid pollination which makes them easier to spot in a crop grown primarily for fibre or seed. Female plants flower and produce seed as well as fibre and are therefore of more economic use and so selective breeding starts.I have seed in my collection from wild stands from across the Caucasus, Siberia, Afghanistan and other areas of Asia.

You *seem* to have missed that I had said It **seems** like it has no advantage, aka, it is an mistaken thought to assume it gave no advantage.My point is that, intelligence did give us a large advantage, however the requirements of the intelligent brain we currently have in the last thousand years or so *was not* what our ancestors had 300,000 years ago.

The person I responded to replied that the *current* advantages are worth it, but the issue isnt that the cons are worth the benefits, but rather You shouldnt judge a past situation based on the current situation. The pros and cons of intelligence in modern brains is not the same as what the pros and cons were 300,000 years ago. The sheer complexity and level of intelligence requires a long development period, and early on when our ancestors had to survive in the wild, they didnt have as smart a mind as we do now, but they also didnt come with the long development process either. As they used their slightly smarter brains to improve things and make gathering food and creating shelter easier and more reliable, that allowed them to better manage the downside of long development time in childhood because less time was need to ensure survival. That allowed longer development, leading to more intelligence, which led to better stabilization of life, which in turn leads to even longer development.

Late life cancers and joint decay. All the parts of aging.They havent evolved away because they have no Reproductive cost.We carry the gene to make our own vitamin C. But its broken. Half of the modern apes still have that gene in the fully functional form. Why do the other half still have the broken gene? Because its not worth deleting.Evolution is capacious because its random.There is some belief that humans were smarter in the past compared to today. Each individual had to know more things and work with fewer viable resources.So we are starting to see smaller brain spaces.And theres some evidence that girls are reaching functional breeding maturity at a time age.But it takes us a long time to evolve because we get only three or four generations per hundred years.The long maturation process may be an evolutionary advantage because we get time to weather the full range of habitat conditions local to where we are raised before we take responsibility for the next generation.(Talking out my ass for a second I find it oddly coincidental with the solar cycle is 11 years long and we basically mature at 24, so we get to see our local variation twice before our brain fully grows up.)So youre not particularly wrong.  We may well be breeding ourselves for shorter childhoods and smaller brains just because of civilization. Its not like its going to happen next year. But over the course of the next several thousand years, it could become significant. Particularly if we dont start mixing our genome better.And the final point is that many of the genes that are responsible for a lot of this stuff are responsible for other things as well.

10032,irry7fp,askscience,"&gt;MTHFMTHFR is short for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which is an enzyme that is involved in getting and removing homocysteine from the blood. Homocysteine is a toxin that the body likes to break down. In 1988, it was found that some people had a gene change in their MTHFR gene. This was a gene change at position 677. This change meant that if an individual had this change, when they were short of a vitamin called folic acid, they were not so good at metabolizing homocysteine. Sorry this is so complicated!After it was discovered, there were studies that suggested just maybe this change was associated with increased risk of having blood clots (VTE). This led to the MTHFR test being added to thrombophilia testing. But in actual fact, it wasnt properly validated. In the last five years, we know from beautiful, large, randomized, controlled trials that MTHFR has nothing to do with a higher rate of blood clots. Indeed, we have learned more than that. We have learned that if we give people with this defect folic acid, it makes no difference to their VTE risk. So I hope you can see that MTHFR testing is therefore not a thrombophilia test. The problem is that lots of labs arent up to date and they have not removed it from their testing. The other problem is that the MTHFR change is present in a single dose in 46% of the population, and a double dose of the change is present in 12% of the population. That means over half of the population have got this change! So, we really shouldnt be testing for something that is expensive to test for and is present in normal people.Here are a few new resources talking about this: https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/news/post/wtd-publishes-new-resources-recommending-mthfr-should-be-removed-thrombophilia-testing-panels/",worldthrombosisday,53,0,1665418270,irqyuef,y0bsu7,1667967093,0,False,0.7886233925819397,0.7478481,trustybob

10149,irsgti5,askscience,"Gas bubbles having such a small diameter shrink in water due to ions existing at the interface between gas and liquid, which in turn increases the ion concentration at the interface and raises the inner pressure and temperature of the bubbles, causing various phenomena to occur.  We think that taking advantage of these phenomena will provide many different possibilities.    In recent years, it was revealed that the micro-nano bubbles have a lot of useful properties. These include the following capabilities:  Sterilization capability:The agglomeration and collapse process of the micro-nano bubbles converts oxygen in the air into active oxygen, creating bactericidal molecules including OH and O3.  Cleaning capability: Ions existing at the gas-liquid interface of the micro-nano bubbles decompose and adsorb oil and fat contamination, which allows removal of the contamination without the need for cleaning agents.  Bio-activation capability: It has been proven that the micro-nano bubbles penetrate deep into biological cells and enhance the immunity of the cells. This has allowed elimination of the need for antibiotics or reduction of the amount of antibiotic usage.  Growth promotion capability: It has been verified that using the micro-nano bubbles allows fish, crustacea and plants to be grown 20 to 30 percent larger than those grown in an ordinary manner.  Cell protection capability: It has been found that oysters grown with the micro-nano bubbles remain alive even if they are frozen to minus 20°C. This is likely because the micro-nano bubbles protect oysters’ cells against damage due to freezing.  Heat transfer capability: The micro-nano bubbles can be used to raise or lower the temperature of a liquid rapidly and effectively.  Vaporization promotion capability: It has been proven that the micro-nano bubbles contained in a liquid promote vaporization of the liquid. Applications based on this effect include highly efficient water-cooled cooling towers and evaporation based desalination systems.  Environmental purification capability: The micro-nano bubbles help restore the biological balance in lakes, rivers or seas and remove odors and toxic substances produced by anaerobic bacteria. This effect stays for a long time even in a large water body such as oceans and seas.",bernpfenn,3,0,1665425722,irpz2z0,y00ioa,1667966537,0,False,0.9139770865440368,0.22060758,perspectivepure2169

But in the case of a bubble, its pressure is equal to the liquid at the level it is in.  But as the bubble ascends through the liquid column, the bubble diameter will increase to maintain pressure.  Now if we take Stokes law and the fact that pressure will vary linearly through the column, but velocity will vary by the square, and terminal velocity will vary by the cube, Id venture to say that the optimal water depth is farthest away from the point where the bubble was created, as R would be the greatest (until structure is no longer supported).",uemcgill,3,0,1665423971,irpfue9,y00ioa,1667966668,0,False,0.752741813659668,0.78026426,crazunggoy47
10153,irscgpn,askscience,"This is a concept in information theory. Language is defined by probability of encountering words. Words with higher probability are simpler to write and simpler to speak, containing less information. Less common words are the opposite. On average, you can determine the information per symbol, and that directly influences the baud rate of a language. Why? Because our minds have to essentially look up symbols in order to use them, so the more common symbols you have in a language, the longer it takes to process that symbol. The tradeoff is that each symbol contains more information.A curious case of this is speedrunners preferring games with Japanese dialog because of the mix of Kanji and Kana, which the game scroll rate does not distinguish between. Kana contains relatively little information because it appears with high probability, while Kanji appears at the same rate, so on average the rate of information is slightly faster in short dialogs.A similar concept also occurs in signal processing in angle modulation. A radio receiver has to distinguish symbols among background noise, caused by electronics and cosmic background radiation. In areas with less noise, the symbol rate and constellation size (which determines the bits per symbol) can increase dramatically. The exact relation is called the [Shannon-Hartley Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem).

Obviously, this is not like the natural growth habit of literally any plant in nature, and usually plants grow in natural habitats as close together as they can get away with, with as great of density as the local environmental conditions will allow, and with a pretty even smattering of various species, size of plant, etc. (obviously size will partly also be a function of how much sunlight a given plant requires, and whether or not it has taller neighbors like trees that they have to overcome or be shaded by). This means that many different plant roots twist around one another and overall form a dense matrix in the topsoil that helps greatly with soil integrity, water and nutrient retention, etc. So not only is farm soil being constantly dug up, dried out, and leached of nutrients, but the natural “skeleton” of the topsoil that is densely-interwoven plant roots isn’t even there to hold it all together, so there tends to be a lot of soil erosion between crop rows, in addition to about half of the soil inevitably ending being of generally poor quality unless measures are taken to assure otherwise. Corn (like maize, for those of you who live in countries where “corn” is a more general term) is a notorious offender for this because of the extreme monoculture and the way industrial cornfields are distributed, and it causes all kind of environmental problems in places like the American Midwestern “corn belt”, mostly due to soil depletion and erosion (while obviously there were multiple other factors at play, and also this happened during a time when farming in the US wasn’t nearly as industrialized as now, lack of crop rotation and general bad agricultural management over decades played a role in the 1930s Dust Bowl catastrophe)",regular_modern_girl,353,0,1665444436,irselxr,y0iphr,1667965233,0,False,0.5489687919616699,0.5930133,brigadierbrinjal

Consequently, theres a spectrum of qualities which allow us to examine whether speciation has occurred in full, in part, or not.Since the standard of a species is the *viable offspring* test, its worth asking what the bare minimum or absolutely necessary change is in order to prohibit the free diffusion of alleles between populations, but still preserve the ability of each population to continue producing viable offspring, just no longer with each other.

You might have to explain what you mean by that.But in any case, youre moving the goalposts. You raised concerns about contamination with gut bacteria and how difficult it is to process sludge:&gt; 1) Contamination, obviously. Bacterias from sewage are by definition the bacterias that can grow well in human gut, and therefore make you really sick. You can kill then through treatment, but if your treatment fails for whatever reason, then youre poisoning a crop. I think its very difficult to get sewage-based fertilizer that can be used for crops (and therefore it might not be economical).You made the outright statement that it is difficult *in and of itself*. But its not difficult. You sterilise it, digest it and then dewater it... very standard, well-understood, widely-deployed processes, and you win additional by-products (biogas) out of the process. No more difficult than the treatment and release of the water-component of wastewater (which arrives similarly contaminated).&gt; Regarding the question of what to do with the sludge, your link answers that question: it can be used to produce biogas to power the treatment plantYes. Producing biogas is *part of the process of caking it*.* Sewage goes through Thermal Hydrolysis, which sterilises it.* Then they feed it through digesters and get methane-rich biogas, which heats homes.* Then its dewatered and sold as cake.Now yes, you could burn the cake instead of spreading it on agricultural land, and then spread the ash, but that reduces its value as an organic material in terms of promoting soil structure.

11012,irwqs0d,askscience,"&gt;Eh? You might have to explain what you mean by that.Very shortly: in the UK its not directly economic efficiency that dictates what you can or cannot do (as in a classic private company). Its whether you can convince the regulator or not that its a good idea. There can be a difference between these two.&gt;You made the outright statement that it is difficult in and of itself. But its not difficult. You sterilise it, digest it and then dewater it... very standard, well-understood, widely-deployed processes, and you win additional by-products (biogas) out of the process. No more difficult than the treatment and release of the water-component of wastewater (which arrives similarly contaminated).No. By difficult I mean its a process that can fail, and that costs money. Just like you could say building a good bridge is difficult, yet good bridges are built all around the world. Sure you can describe it as you just dry it and heat it up, but in practice there are a couple of details to iron out, thats why there have been contamination issues in other instances, both through heavy metals and bacterias. I dont think there is much point debating the word of difficult here, since we both agree it is feasible with the right process. The whole process costs money too, which was part of my point, but maybe indeed just calling it difficult (in the sense of many issues to be addressed) was not the right word here. That is probably the main reason why the practice is not done everywhere in the world where you have farmland and sewage treatment (which is a lot of places).&gt;Now yes, you could burn the cake instead of spreading it on agricultural land, and then spread the ash, but that reduces its value as an organic material in terms of promoting soil structure. If all you care about is a couple of chemical inputs then sure... but bio-solids are about a lot more than simple chemistry.Nothing in here tells me that one is cheaper/more efficient than the other. Maybe it depends on various local factors, but both practices exist.&gt;Its not that complicated. They dump it out a bulk truck and spread it. No, its not quite as neat as bagged synthetic fertilisers but its not complex.Same as above. It involves many operations that end up costing money. Biosolids might have a lot of value, but using them costs a lot of money. Thats why its not done everywhere.I dont know if that is because of poor decision-making in places that dont do it, or if its because of a flaw in the decision-making process of this UK example, and I dont think we can figure that one out here.

11048,irx93bx,askscience,"This is harder to do for people who learned how to read phonetically than for those who learn to read using whole-language theory. With phonetics, you learn how each letter sounds, and then scan a word start to finish sounding out the letters with the final sound you make being matched to a word that you already know how to say. While in whole-language you essentially learn how an entire word looks (the way it is shaped) rather than focusing on each letter. Because of the way the brain processes and compresses information, the first and last letters are much more important to identifying the “shape” of a word than the letters in the middle, which must merely be present. This phenomenon is also linked to dyslexia in humans, which essentially represents the same process occurring in reverse.  This can make it faster to read text, but comes at the disadvantage of making it more difficult to read or pronounce words that a reader has never encountered before. Readers who learn phonetically can usually read more complicated writing earlier than whole language learners— though they may not fully understand the meaning of the words they are reading, context clues help them to assign meaning in the absence of access to a definition.There is a lot of really interesting research into the different methods that can be employed to teach a person how to read— and because it’s one of the earliest skills a person typically learns, it can actually shape the way that we interpret information in general throughout our lives.

The fluid would exert a force if it was constrained in a closed system.

Hence no force normal/perpendicular to the surface of the Earth.You can skip all of that complexity and just look at conservation of momentum. If we look at a frame of reference where the earth-rocket system is a rest before the launch, the total momentum of the system after the launch has to be zero. So if the rocket is moving relative to the earth, the earth must move as well.This also allows us to estimate the effect on the earth: The change in velocity is rocket_velocity*(rocket_mass/earth_mass), which is too tiny to be measured - the earth mass is a hell of a lot larger than the rocket mass.All of this is disregarding the orbit around the sun, but it works even if you incorporate that, it just becomes a lot more complicated.",sfurbo,3,0,1665560134,irxoywy,y1h3y2,1667958640,0,False,0.9840259552001952,0.88025516,madmarq64

However, it is important to note that any NEO deflection effort must produce an actual orbital change much larger than predicted orbital uncertainties from all perturbation sources, including the Yarkovsky effect.&gt; ...&gt; Therefore, a 1000-kg GT spacecraft equipped with ion engines can be considered as a viable option for a pre-2029 deflection mission for Apophis. However, it is emphasized that a 1000-kg spacecraft, colliding with Apophis at a modest impact velocity of 10 km/s in 2026, will cause a much larger, instantaneous velocity change of at least 0.22 mm/s for Apophis, resulting in an orbital deflection of 62 km in 2029. Such a higher-energy kinetic impactor approach may not be applicable to highly porous, rubble-pile asteroids, while a GT spacecraft mission may need an additional large ∆V to rendezvous with a target asteroid. Consequently, further system- level tradeoffs on various practical issues, such as the total mission ∆V requirement, low-thrust gravity tow- ing vs. higher-energy kinetic impact, and asteroid dispersal/fragmentation concern, need to be performed. That dispersal / fragmentation concern is part of what DART is interested in.One of the other aspects to consider is the what if it goes wrong?  Not a we miss but rather we mostly succeed.

Especially now that farming is an almost entirely industrial enterprise in the developed world, crop fields are run like factories, and it’s only very recently that people have been seriously considering all the problems that this model leads to (on a number of different fronts, besides soil degradation issues there’s also all the problems borne of excessive pesticide and herbicide use that is decimating biodiversity, the fact that deforestation or other total disruptions of local ecology are prerequisites to a lot of large-scale farming practices, all the problems on many levels that come from monocultures, etc.). Essentially, we need another “green revolution” like happened in the 1950s-60s (when crop rotation became more standard practice and there were changes in what fertilizers were used, etc. potentially staving off a catastrophic global food supply collapse that had been warned of for decades as a result of population growth. Unfortunately, a number of current problems were the direct result of some of the solutions from this period), especially if we’re to seriously tackle other related existential threats to the biosphere like climate change, and this is part of why experimental agricultural science is an increasingly popular (and well-funded) field of study.",regular_modern_girl,1,0,1665593463,irwegp2,y0iphr,1667956831,0,False,0.8546419143676758,0.51415837,jaggedcanyon69

As you completely correctly wrote, the parts of the ocean with the right conditions to create very dense water masses (e.g. the marginal seas of the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean) are the parts of the ocean where deep water formation occurs. You cant have an overturning circulation without deep water formation. But this isnt an energy source, because no energy input is required for dense waters to sink below lighter waters. The problem is that, in order to have vigorous overturning, these dense waters have to somehow be returned to the surface (and at a significant rate). Theres no process in the deep-ocean that adds (non-negligible) freshwater or heat, so the deep waters cant rise buoyantly. As a result, the only way water can return to the surface is by being dragged up by wind-induced upwelling, or (probably to a lesser extent) mechanically mixed up, probably mainly due to tides. What exactly are the key processes that determine the strength of the AMOC is an active research question, and the freshening of the North Atlantic is absolutely capable of reducing the AMOC strength (because if youre generating deep water at a lower rate, youre also going to upwell less deep water), but the point is that deep water formation isnt a _driver_ (or energy source) of the overturning.",chlorophilia,216,0,1665598375,is1t12y,y23ytd,1667956454,0,False,0.9096745252609252,0.4472864,jellyfixh

The influence of abiotic chemical reactions, for example degradation due to humic acid, is also significant but is highly variable and difficult to study in isolation. In the case of prions there are at least two studies that suggest that humic acids reduce the infectivity of prions in soil. In other words that the acids present in soil do denature prions to some degree. Whether or not this process is fast enough to outweigh the ongoing spread of prions depends a lot on the behaviour of the animals in question. In deer Chronic Wasting Disease is spreading rapidly across North America and is now present in Asia and Europe. It has not however spread all that widely outside of the deer population, suggesting animal behaviour is a significant component of infectivity. That is to say as long as you refrain from eating dead deer brains and/or the soil around dead deer brains it is probably not a huge issue.Another factor both concerning and reassuring is that the spread of these prion diseases seems to have been at least partially man made. Mad cow disease was likely spread to cattle from sheep by the actions of humans. Deer CWD is also possibly a result of deer and sheep being kept in close proximity in the US in the past several decades. In other words modern agriculture may be one of the culprits in spreading prion disease. Possibly this means prion disease will become an increasingly difficult problem.

Deep water formation by surface buoyancy forcing at high latitudes is not the only way that abyssal waters can be renewed.  A thought experiment: an isothermal isohaline ocean is subjected to ekman pumping from surface wind stress in one region. Upwelled water would subsequently redistribute away. Conservation of volume dictates that the upwelled waters are replaced, and of course they are by surrounding waters at depth, possibly many depths. An overturning circulation will become established, with waters away from the upwelling site sinking to replace the upwelled waters, although the sinking is more akin to falling, as there is a decrease in the volume of waters below.  Possibly the sinking would occur uniformly over the entire non-upwelling basin, or it might be confined to an area around to upwelling, but the resulting overturning circulation would look different than our current MOC.The rate of surface water transformation depends only on local buoyancy forcing and initial seawater properties, it doesnt know about remote upwelling rates. However, if upwelling ceases, the abyss would eventually fill up with  dense transformed water and the rising isopycnal of that deep water would eventually limit the depth to which the newly formed dense water sinks.

Correlation is not causation, just because something appears to conveniently fit what we would like the outcome to be doesn’t mean to say we shouldn’t test the absolute blazes out of it to make absolutely sure.  If you look at life in the oceans today, and life living on the edge of the oceans.  It spends a fair amount of energy pumping out salt.  Fish for example push out a lot of salt in their urine, and their kidneys work hard to do it.  Ever tasted sea fish and added just a touch of salt to it to make it taste better? Weird when you think about it, soy sauce is very salty.  Sea water today is about three times more salty than blood, it’s why you can’t drink it safely.Where does this leave us with your original question?  Well the ratio of chemicals in the blood differs significantly from that of sea water.  Yet we don’t drink sea water to survive, we get those other solutes from our food. One of the many indicators of life is the ability to do this, to push chemicals up a solution gradient using energy.

12644,is5dz0p,askscience,"My fluid dynamics lectures were a while ago, so Ill do my best and wait for somebody with a firmer grasp on the topic to correct me. Ill try to explain the different cases that are generally distinguished in fluid dynamics:Even our tiny air particles have mass and thereby inertia - they will not slide out of the way without pushing back. In *incompressible* flow scenarios this just means that the flow is redirected - we have changed the impulse of air particles and, as a reaction, experience a higher pressure on the front of our object than on the back. This way of thinking is useful enough for calculations up until  ~Mach 0.3 and engineers are glad they can use simple models. Above that mach number, compressibility effects start to make themselves known. Now, the density of the air due to flow conditions changes drastically enough, that our simple model is no longer accurate enough for most purposes and the compressibility effects increase further into the transsonic regime, where first supersonic effects, such as shocks appear where the local flow temporarily exceeds the speed of sound - the velocity, at which the air particles communicate and get out of our way.Since reentry conditions are in the range of &gt;&gt;Mach 1, the air particles cannot get out of the way fast enough and are squashed against each other directly on our heat shield, heating up themselves (keywords for further reading: stagnation point, stagnation temperature) and the heat shield (partly through contact, mostly by radiation from that hot plasma cloud I think).I hope I explained the difference between *incompressible* and *compressible* flow well enough. Skin friction: As far as I know, due to the shockwave in front of our object, there is an area of flow trapped around it that does not exchange a lot of impulse with the free stream outside - making the relative velocity of adjacent flow and object quite small. Also, with low density and low viscosity of the trapped air, I would not assume this to be a significant effect.Friction inside the air probably contributes to the whole affair, but I would assume that it is less significant in supersonic flow conditions.",anotherloststudent,10,0,1665665848,is50lgr,y2o5k2,1667952618,0,False,0.9946935772895812,0.4740856,the_some_guy

Then we started looking in the forensic literature and as it turns out, incomplete consumption can actually help dry out skin longer term. Heres what we think happened - at least two carnivores partially ate Dakota (a croc-relative at the arm and an indeterminate croc or theropod at the tail). This opened holes into the body cavity, which could then act as escape routes for the gases and liquids associated with decomposition. Once all of that internal goo was removed from Dakota, the remaining skin, draped over the bones, could dry more quickly and easily.

April 2068)The United States, in an attempt to divert the asteroid known as [99942 Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis) from hitting the western seaboard of North America sent several megatons of explosives with the goal of diverting the asteroid from hitting the Earth.The mission was successful in that it did indeed divert the asteroid - but the amount of impulse wasnt sufficient and upon inspection of the debris after the explosion it still has significant chunks of mass.  The asteroid wasnt one large chunk but rather four large components loosely glued together.  The asteroid was slowed down slightly, but not sufficiently and instead of having a large event that would have [obliterated a large part of California](https://www.planetary.org/articles/will-apophis-hit-earth) it is now raining down city destroying sized chunks across China, India, Pakistan, and Russia.The ambassador to the UN representing these countries have accused the United States of plots ranging from incompetence and poor planing to intentionally diverting the asteroid so that it destroyed cities in their countries resulting in tens of millions of deaths and crippled their economic and industrial capacities.----The approach of blow it up is not necessarily the best choice.

And you can always circularize your orbit later, and then use transfer orbits to get to the correct altitude. Maybe do a plane change if necessary.Pretty much none of that is possible with the Lagrange points.

You can tell by your use of future tense in the word sending.   Yes, potential breakup is a VERY real problem and engineers and physicists have recognized the potential for this for decades.  While Dimorphos is the most likely type of asteroid to hit earth, its far from the ONLY kind. This is why we need to test and indeed there are multiple types/methods being discussed/proposed for at least the last decade.   Breakup means exactly what it sounds like. Here are your points:   The pieces would have to separate at more than escape velocity or they’d re-combine under gravity.     -Yes, now that the energy calculated to slow the asteroid via direct impact on a solid object was instead redirected into many parts traveling outward and in doing so, takes that energy away from its intended purpose, the effectiveness of the impactor has been vastly reduced, maybe so much so that the asteroids velocity is not effectively altered and still makes impact with earth. Potentially even more likely now that it will likely be torn back apart by the earth and moons gravitational forces as it nears.    If they separate at more than escape velocity everything is probably fine.  - How is turning one large problem into many smaller problems going to make it all fine? Again, energy is never lost, if the asteroid breaks up, the effectiveness of the impactor is GREATLY reduced in a very unpredictable way.

13194,is8tr98,askscience,"OK, less than 1 minute in, and that video is very wrong. Density in and of itself has an inverse relationship with speed of sound. Higher density reduces the speed of sound. The speed of sound also depends on the elastic properties (stiffness or rigidity) of a material and between very different materials (like steel, water, and air) that is generally what makes more of the difference in the speed of sound. Sound travels faster in steel than water, and in water than air not because of the increases in density, but because steel is stiffer and less compressible than water, which is stiffer and less compressible than air. The higher elastic moduli (mostly lower compressibility), or basically higher stiffness or rigidity, more than offsets the decrease in the speed of sound that would be caused by the higher density.The speed of sound in a material isv = sqrt((K + 4/3 mu) / rho)Note that density (rho) is in the denominator, while elastic properties are in the numerator. K is the bulk modulus, which is 1 / compressibility (more compressible materials have a lower bulk modulus). Mu is the shear modulus, which for liquids and gases is zero. That leavesv = sqrt (K / rho)as the speed of sound in liquids and gases. But for gases the bulk modulus is equal the [adiabatic index (gamma)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity_ratio) times pressure, and the terms from the ideal gas law cancel out so pressure does not affect the speed of sound in an (ideal) gas. Rather speed of sound in a gas varies with temperature, the molar mass of the gas, and the type of molecule, sov_idealgas = sqrt(gamma * R * T / M)Where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, M is the molar mass, and gamma is the adiabtic index.Now, real gases/materials are not quite ideal and so the speed of a sound can vary with frequency--i.e. dispersion as addressed by the other answer. But near standard pressure and temperature, dispersion in air is negligible.Seehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_soundEdited to clarify: Density affects the speed of sound in a gas, but pressure does not. However, the effect of density is rolled into the molar mass and temperature, so it is not needed to calculate the speed of sound in a gas.

13219,is92qv6,askscience,"What you’re referencing here with emergency vehicles is the Doppler effect. Due to the relative velocities of the source (ambulance) and the observer (you) there is a perceived frequency shift. The waves aren’t moving any faster or slower than the speed of sound in the particular medium (in this case the air) but because you are moving towards or away from each other it seems like are hitting your ear slightly faster or slower than usual. Frequency is just the number of waves per second. Since the source is moving the waves hit your ears at slightly different speeds which the brain registers as different frequencies of sound. Dispersion is the spreading out of a wave. Think about lighting a candle in a dark room. The light fills the entire space but is brighter the closer you are to the source (the candle). With dispersion the waves spread out but because the energy is more spread out, the amplitude of the waves goes down. Sound waves are radial and so they expand outward in all directions evenly AS LONG AS THE MEDIUM IS CONSTANT! With a longitudinal wave or pressure wave (waves that need particle collisions in order to travel), like sound the frequency is fixed by the source and so to change the speed of the wave you must change its wavelength. Well the wavelength of a sound wave is determined by the material it’s traveling through (the medium). This is a vast over simplification but you can think of speed through a medium to be determined by how close the particles are and how springy the molecular bonds are. So in a gas, particles are pretty far apart so sound travels slower (less stuff, less speed). In a solid with high modulus of elasticity the particles are super close together and super springy so sounds move much faster because the particles collide more quickly.",dr_minimo,10,0,1665722842,is8vy1g,y304qu,1667948637,0,False,0.952299952507019,0.6472757,j3zombie

13243,is9b08t,askscience,"(I was speaking rather loosely with rigidity and compressibility. Strictly speaking, the shear modulus, mu, is rigidity, which is zero for liquids and gases and positive for solids. The bulk modulus K is 1 / compressibility. For the speed of a P wave in a solid, both are needed.)Seismic body waves are a generalization of sound waves and you may be familiar with the general formula for P wave velocity, identical to the initial speed of sound formula given above:v_p = sqrt((K + 4/3 mu) / rho)while S wave velocity isv_s = sqrt(mu / rho)Density and the elastic moduli are distinct physical properties. There tend to be empirical relationships between them, but no simple or single law or relationship that relates solely these quantities. Often the effect of higher density reducing the speed is overcome by the much higher elastic moduli contributing to a higher speed of sound. In short, denser things are often less compressible and more rigid, but that is not necessarily true in general (core vs. lower mantle velocities, for example). Density and elastic properties can also happen to work together to increase the seismic/sound speed. For example, solid ice (ice 1h) has a higher sound/seismic velocity than liquid water, contributed to both by lower density, higher incompressibility and higher rigidity.Since you are specifically talking about near surface rocks, porosity is also important. More porous rocks like sandstone have more air (and/or water) in them, which has a slower speed of sound, for the above reasons. So the speed of sound in the solid/fluid composite material is much reduced relative to the more solid material.But a counterexample is trivial: While the outer core is much denser than the overlying mantle, it has a much lower P-wave velocity. Well it is liquid, so perhaps thats not so surprising compared to a solid. However, even the solid inner core (~11.3 km/s P wave velocity) is slower than the lower mantle (~13.6 km/s P wave velocity).

13436,isad23u,askscience,"There’s a lot of stuff going on physiologically when you put a constant force on a tooth, but that mostly involves gradually breaking down and rebuilding - or “remodeling” - the tooth socket walls. The periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers don’t do much themselves during tooth movement other than compress or relax and resist displacement of the tooth from the original center of the tooth socket. It’s actually a bit of a problem, because their natural rate of turnover (replacement of old fibers with new fibers) is slow and because tooth movement doesn’t seem to accelerate the rate of turnover for many of the PDL fiber components. That means that the fibers that were stretched during tooth movement will remain stretched and continue to apply a force that would return the tooth to its original position. This is one of the primary reasons for **relapse** following orthodontic treatment (in addition to continuous forces applied by the cheeks, lips, tongue, and jaws), and it’s why retainers are almost always recommended following orthodontic treatment.  For an idea of the timescale over which PDL and gingival fibers experience turnover, consider that the biological half-life of collagen fibers is about 9 weeks and that the half-life for elastin fibers is over 70 years! Meanwhile, bone can begin remodeling in as little as a week following force application to a tooth. Interestingly, it’s the most accessible fibers around the neck of the tooth (just under the surface of the gums) that seem to provide the bulk of the relapse force discussed above, while the deeper fibers seem to remodel into more relaxed conformations within several months. So one method to reduce relapse - particularly for previously severely rotated teeth - is to sever those “supracrestal fibers” by cutting straight down through the gingival sulcus (gum pocket) to about the level of bone with either a scalpel or a laser. This is called a circumferential supracrestal gingival fiberotomy.",astroglaid92,13,0,1665754866,is9meel,y31em9,1667947248,0,False,0.9921892881393432,0.54233634,ademoney
13438,isad2im,askscience,"&gt;So you’re saying higher density is not related to rigidity?  Not inherently, no.&gt;I’m geology we use speed of sound through a rock layer as a proxy for density in seismic surveys. Where all the rock layers are completely rigid higher density does translate to faster speed of sound. Ex: shale is faster than sandstone or carbonates, and basalt is one of the fastestIf a substance is completely rigid, then it is meaningless to talk about a speed of sound because the speed of sound would be infinite in a completely rigid material.___Maybe in geology, the average stiffnesses of typical rocks or minerals correlate with density well enough to use density as a rule of thumb proxy, but its not true in general that higher density means higher stiffness. As an example, elemental lead has a density of about 11 g/cc and a Youngs modulus, which is uniaxial stiffness, of 14 GPa.  Elemental iron is much less dense, at about 7.8 grams per cubic centimeter, but its Youngs modulus is 200 GPa.

13538,isbi1rp,askscience,"&gt;To clarify, I guess what I meant by “distinguish” is whether or not different isotopes behave fundamentally differently as far as biochemistry is concernedI would maintain that if the isotopes are incorporated at different rates (as they indeed are), then they behave differently by definition. Im not sure what fundamentally means here - if you mean substantially in the sense of having biological relevance, then I would say no, they do not. But biological relevance itself has no objective definition. I could say that they form the same sort of chemical bonds, but thats not actually *entirely* true, just *mostly* true, of isotopes.&gt;or is it just a side effect of getting carbon from CO2 in the air versus carbonic acid/carbonate in the water?I should specify that CO2 ultimately comes from the atmosphere in both cases. The difference is the carboxylation reaction in C3 plants uses carbon dioxide directly, whereas in C4 plants, CO2 first reacts with water to form bicarbonate before being conjugated to an organic molecule. The relevant factors for fractionation are therefore the diffusion rate of 13CO2 and 12CO2 in the gaseous state, and the preferences for the relevant enzymes for each carbon isotope.The underlying physical principles are the same here as in the case of neutron-free hydrogen vs. deuterium. The difference is just one of degree. Carbon-13 is 8.3% heavier than Carbon-12, while deuterium is twice as heavy as hydrogen. Moreover, hydrogen atoms (of all isotopes) are commonly transferred between compounds individually, whereas single carbon atoms do not appear in biological reactions. (In the specific case of carbon fixation, the carbon makes up a minority of the mass of the molecule that actually participates in the reaction.) The discrimination between hydrogen and deuterium in chemical and physical processes is therefore as high as it could possibly be for stable isotopes, and the differences in rates between them is therefore maximal compared to other elements.

Lets consider nerve generation during fetal development. And, I will consider the development of the corpus callosum as an exampke. I am trying to establish a thread from peripheral stimulus to tbe brain and its physical actuation in the peripheral muscle. In the corpus callosum, it is my understanding that the nerves of each hemisphere extend to the bilateral line, each neuron with a signaling code on the exrtending region. During development each nerve, if possible, will bind in some fashion with a nerve with a complementary code. The codes determine the appropriate destination for each signaling neuron. Further, it is my understanding that the large number of connections are not coded in the DNA, but rather have a Zip-Code and an address. The allows repeated addresses, but not within the same Zip-Code. This works fine for cerebral neurons. But, for motor neurons, which require confirmation there must be a pairing to allow all bi-direction signaling.  My hypothesis is that this could occur in multiple ways. Either the nerves are bundled (which you disparage), or the pairing occurs through correlation, either in the foetus or during later development.

I think the only political worry would be miscalculation in putting it in a stable orbit. Presumably, mining it would also effect the orbit, whatever tools and methods would have to be incredibly precise to not effect the orbit, and just taking mass away from it in the form of metals and water would cause it to change orbit.

Some genes that code for characteristics unique to Mimivirus, including those coding for the capsid, have been conserved in a variety of viruses which infect organisms from all domains. This has been used to suggest that Mimivirus is related to a type of DNA virus that emerged before cellular organisms and played a key role in the development of all life on Earth. An alternative hypothesis is that there were three distinct types of DNA viruses that were involved in generating the three known domains of life—eukarya, archaea and bacteria.

The only way you would get this is if dark matter happens to be in the form of MACHOs (massive compact halo objects) such as black holes, but that hypothesis has almost been completely ruled out except for a range of masses that excludes things anywhere near the Earths mass.  So, this just isnt an actual possibility, Im afraid!&gt;... does that mean we would suddenly find ourselves falling toward it for seemingly no reason?We would feel its gravitational effects, yes.  If you had something like an Earth-mass MACHO, it could do things like disrupt orbits, to the extent that something of Earth mass can do so (naturally something like the Sun or Jupiter wouldnt be significantly affected, but smaller planets would).&gt;Im assuming we havent observed dark matter at smaller than galactic scales, but Im wondering if the current theories and observations allow for smaller amounts as well.Unfortunately, not really ... at least, not also in grouped clumps that are within a few orders of magnitude of the Earths mass.

If you are a naked mole rat, you spend your whole life underground feeding on roots in warrens where you have the rest of the colony around to help drive off predators and collect food.

Basically, a bunch of people around the US (and maybe elsewhere) suddenly began going to doctors complaining of some really bizarre symptoms, such as itching and general skin irritation, lesions, sensations of “crawling” under the skin, panic (and iirc some also reported memory loss), and strangest of all, the appearance of inexplicable colorful fibers in their lesions (which were claimed by the patients to be growing out of their skin), and in some cases also supposed sightings of tiny black gnats or flies exiting the lesions.Initially, some of the medical community took the whole thing seriously, and I believe there was even a CDC investigation to see if it was in fact some novel epidemic, but fairly quickly a lot of doctors grew a lot more skeptical when they couldn’t really find any signs of any sort of parasite or pathogen whatsoever in the patients (I think it was reported briefly that a number of them had previously suffered Lyme disease, but this may not have turned out to be a significant enough correlation), and also the fact that lab tests of the mysterious fibers revealed mundane, household sources for the most part (implying that patients were placing them in the lesions themselves, and probably creating the lesions with excessive scratching).A lot of medical professionals dismissed the whole thing as an unusually-widespread example of Münchausen syndrome (which is p much a fancy medical way of saying “bullshitting for attention”), but there were also some more charitable assessments that it was actually an unusual epidemic of delusional parasitosis (where, again because of the nocebo effect, a person actually starts experiencing signs of parasitic infestation simply by psyching themselves into believing they have parasites) spreading as a culture-bound syndrome (partly due to the internet). In my humble opinion, I think it was probably some mixture of both genuine psychogenic illness and Münchausen.From what I understand, the whole thing calmed down after a few years and people stopped reporting “Morgellons” symptoms mostly, although I’ve heard it still occasionally pops up as a thing even to this day.It just goes to show that, even though there’s a popular perception of culture-bound syndromes as a phenomenon of less enlightened past times and “primitive” cultures, something that we educated Westerners are surely above, the thing is we’re not, we’re still human and just as subject to these things as anyone else, really no matter how “rational” we think we are.",regular_modern_girl,3,0,1665808737,isd4xun,y3xbur,1667943590,0,False,0.8523231148719788,0.4388852,kodasmash12

Not really, juvenile cancers exist. It you’re talking about dying of mostly cancers, then it’s a factor of senescence, which is generally relative to the species’ natural lifespan (though as all things biological it’s complicated).With the exception of very short lifespans, or a complete lack of *senescent purging* (removal and replacement of old cells, if there’s no growth there’s no cancer), aging will translate in a weakening of the immune system (immunosenescence), and since it participates in the suppression of cancers this will then translate into increased rates of cancer. Other biological systems will age similarly.Short-lived species also have somewhat lower rates of cancers because the vast majority of cancers have their source in genetic damage / mutations, so older cells from longer-lived organisms have higher odds of having such damage.

At higher frequencies, just looking at the phase difference between two pure tones wouldnt tell the frequency. A phase difference between the ears of say, 0.2 wavelengths could mean an actualy path length different, for a tone of high enough frequency, of 0.2, 1.2, 2.2, etc wavelengths.Fortunately, at higher frequencies, the sound is attenuated enough by the skull that the difference in *intensity* between the ears becomes useful to localise sound at about the same frequency range where the phase difference becomes less useful.And of course, for varied sounds rather than pure tones, the time delay in changes in the envelope is always useful.As for location in the fore/aft and up/down direction (since interaural time and intensity differences only localise a sound source onto a cone), that is where the shape of the outer visible part of the ear (the pinna) comes in.

If you were to compare on a gene by gene basis then probably none of our genes would be the exact same as a bananas. We and bananas also have multitudes of genes that are exclusive to us or them due to the structural differences and the long long evolutionary divergence.So a 0.6% difference in genetic sequence between humans including not just base pairs of genes but also non coding sequences is actually really tiny.

Dichromats have genes for seeing in green and red, so a mutation in an ancestral population caused a duplication of one of these genes and allowed for us to see more in fuller colour.

14569,isidl7k,askscience,"Scientifically possible isnt a useful target for discussion.In short: Yes, its scientifically possible. COVID-19 evolved from other coronaviruses that didnt have the trasmissability that it has. That said, there is a difference between scientifically possible (ie: We can imagine a scenario that adheres to science where this thing could happen) and scientifically plausible. In general, viruses/bacteria that cause diseases dont evolve to be extremely deadly due to natural selection. Its more random chance. Natural selection is going to favor diseases that are more easily spread, and individuals with severe symptoms or a lack of a pulse dont spread diseases well (because we dont hang out around them). If anything, COVID-19s pandemic super-power (and one of our biggest lessons) was its ability to rapidly replicate without immediate symptoms. That let it spread faster and to a wider degree than other Coronaviruses, and most other respiratory viruses. Until COVID-19, the general wisdom said that serious respiratory illnesses were transmissable when symptoms (coughing, sneezing, exhaustion) started. As soon as those symptoms showed up (in COVID-19 or other diseases) people would (unless they are jerks) isolate themselves, or at least take actions to not spread disease as much.The mutation of COVID-19, as expected, favored transmissability rather than lethality. It preferred immune avoidance rather than increasing infection severity. These are both evolutionary strategies that tend to make you more likely to spread.Compare COVID-19 to some of the most successful viruses in history: rhinovirus and herpes. Neither of these are considered lethally dangerous viruses. While there will always be risks, their ubiquity is the result of forming more of a parasitic relationship with humans rather than trying to kill us.So... Yes, its scientifically possible. We cant do anything to prevent that scenario from happening, because by its very nature it is caused by changes that we dont really expect and cant foresee. Instead, the vast majority of experience and evidence says that diseases like COVID-19 either kind of fizzle out (as their symptoms are severe enough for us to quarantine them into non-existence like SARS), get outcompeted by things like rhinovirus or influenza, or evolve into milder forms and join the ranks of the viruses that cause the background illnesses in the human experience.",malastare-,5,0,1665898320,isi6src,y4fzec,1667938443,0,False,0.974628448486328,0.75696015,lasvegasboy

They were not forced to drink alcohol - high-drinking rats from an outbred population (I believe Wistars) were bred with other high-drinkings rats for many generations, resulting in a strain of rats that *overall* consumes more than other outbred populations. This hits on natural occurring rats - there are most certainly outbred rats that consume high levels of alcohol. Thats how these types of specialized strains are generated. If youre interested in the P rats, I suggest reading Bell et al. 2006 *Addict Biol* (REVIEW: The alcohol-preferring P rat and animal models of excessive alcohol drinking), if you can access it.Third, people arent bred to do anything. Yes, almost everything has a genetic component, from alcohol use to schizophrenia and cancer. Generally, though, genes drive 20% of less of the variance in the likelihood that youll develop whatever youre genetically pre-disposed towards. So yes, someone with two parents with an alcohol use disorder is more likely to also develop an alcohol use disorder. But that doesnt mean that they find alcohol to be more addicting. It also doesnt mean that the only people with familial history of alcohol use disorders will develop an alcohol use disorder.Fourth, non-peer reviewed books by singular experts are *their personal interpretation and beliefs* of the state of the field. They can be great starting places to introduce yourself to something. If you find yourself super interested, though, I always suggest to navigate directly to the source material and read it yourself, then make your own informed position.

It even has its own name in that area - Fournier’s Gangrene.Now, the trunk is generally well perfused. So is the head, as opposed to the periphery (and especially feet/toes). So why do we see it more there as opposed to in appendages? Because that area has folds that, especially in overweight people, stay moist and warm. Friction between the skin in the folds can create openings for letting in bacteria. Some people are already prone to boils here, which contributes to risk. And some people don’t have the best hygiene. All of this together, and usually with an accompanying complication like diabetes, alcohol dependence, truck drivers (long periods of vibration increasing friction between folds), etc. makes this area of the body ripe for this particular infection.I have seen nec fasc in arms that had to be amputated.

The issue is the original study labeled easy access to drugs a primary cause based on the research; which Id argue the primary cause was rather the extreme loneliness and abject misery the rats lived in. If youre completely alone and miserable, being kept in solitary confinement your whole life... well why not use drugs heavily at that point? Your life cant possibly suck worse, it offers a brief respite, and (hypothetically if rats were actually capable of comprehending the risks) even if it kills you at least the hell is over. The main issue is that we continue to do studies today on isolated rats when not specifically studying the effects of isolation on X. Who knows to what extent abject misery effects the results of those experiments. Prolonged high levels of cortisol (stress hormone) which are generally present in isolated rats effects brain development, physical, and mental health. So all studies we do on isolated rats (like cancer treatments and the like) are being done on miserable animals who have negative health effects from high levels of prolonged stress. That has to have some impact, and not a positive one.Again, if youre studying the effects of isolation on whatever than yeah, isolation is an important factor (but ideally there should also be a control group of happy, well-socialized rats to compare the isolated group to at the end). But when youre studying literally anything else than isolation it is going to likely affect your results.

Bacteria that stumble into the blood stream are often destroyed immediately via the complement system and then somewhat unexpectedly by red blood cells . The chance a white blood cell would randomly bump into a free floating bacterium is fairly low.

The goal has moved to building smaller electric boats with batteries that get swapped out at the port.  They also make more stops than current ships, which presents an interesting problem with shipping queues at ports...Panamax style ships have engines about 80 MW in size.  Crudely, the batteries required for the duration of the voyage would weigh more than the carrying capacity of the boat.  Batteries are really inefficient with poor energy density when compared to almost any liquid/gas fuel.On-board generation of even 5% of that required energy is 400kW.  Plug that into any calculator for roof top solar and you will find the area required is massive.You also want the solar panel to be angled correctly towards the sun.

15301,isn5zdq,askscience,"To touch on the climate part and the fragility of ocean life &amp; ecosystems and how it effects it. I’ll give you a good example. Have you ever had a fish tank? The most common (and easier to maintain) type is freshwater, which is what I keep and have more experience with. I currently have 4. A 30 gallon, a 10 gallon, and 2 5 gallons. They all have substrate(dirt), sand, and live plants. Now the most important thing in keeping fish, is maintaining the correct water parameters. Certain types of fish need certain parameters/environments in order to not only live, but breed. Some are heartier than others and can live in wider ranges. Same goes for breeding. My 30 gallon tank is easiest to maintain those parameters since there’s more water &amp; it will take more time for the parameters to change enough to harm or kill the fish. The smaller tanks can be tricky, since the less water, the quicker and more drastic the parameters can change. I’f you’re not careful the fish could be dead in less than 24 hrs if there’s an issue with said parameters, or heat, and the whole tanks ecosystem can “crash” pretty fast afterwards. And the crazy part is, it doesn’t take all that much of a variance to wreck an ecosystem. Sure these are small, man made ecosystems. But it’s an excellent example of just how fragile they can be.Now saltwater tanks. Those are pretty advanced in most cases. The only reasons I haven’t gotten into that are because they are incredibly expensive to set up (a decent size is going to cost you thousands) and expensive and difficult to maintain. Go check out r/reeftank and check out beginner info to see what goes into it. Even big tanks require a lot of maintaining to just keep everything alive and the water balanced. It’s another excellent example because it’s a little slice of our ocean. Check out the posts about tank crashes and whatnot. You’ll see all sorts of reasons. Heater broke and couldn’t replace it fast enough? Dead fish. Heater malfunctioned and was running 2-3 degrees hotter? Dead. Used some sort of cheap plastic decoration? The chemicals leached out of it into the water, dead fish. The seemingly smallest things can send these small tiny micro slices of ocean down a death spiral at the drop of a hat. Seriously check out aquarium communities and their failures and accidents. It takes a ton of effort to create and maintain a functional ecosystem by hand, *and we have various chemicals to help us do it* (fish tanks, not the ocean). The ocean is no different, it’s just a MUCH bigger tank. So yeah, ocean life (all life really), and ecosystems are incredibly fragile. It’s pretty sad, ocean life now is a husk of what it was just a century or two ago. Overfishing is a huge issue.

But if the individual effect of B on X is small you’d need a lot of measurements, let’s say 10, in order to get statistical significant results. But now you’ve found only the influence of one factor. To find  out about all other factors can be prohibitively time and or resources consuming. So what you do is varying all or subsets of your factors at once while measuring the effect on X. But how can anyone make sense of the data then? How can you tell which factor was responsible for any measured effect of X? Here comes PCA. The dataset is then fitted into a multidimensional space with each influencing factor representing an orthogonal axis. The cloud of datapoints is then modeled by a multidimensional but linear function. The you look at how this line lies in that space in regard to the individual axises. Axis ie factors that run parallel or close to parallel don’t have a lot of influence, while axis that are orthogonal or close to it have a very high influence.

My largest customer in the UK was a large  electroplating company called William Canning of Birmingham. They called saccharin a brightener but actually it is simply a zinc crystal disruptor and acts at the boundaries of the deposited zinc crystals as the zinc ions attach to the surface during electroplating. The optical effect of large zinc crystals is avoided using saccharin. The saccharin molecules act as a kind of traffic control officer at the boundary edges and new crystals are formed which are so small the surface will appear to be polished.I believe a similar effect is seen with zinc/nickel and pure nickel electroplating as well. The effect is seen immediately after electroplating and is not a corrosion induced artifact. It is always amazing to look at a zinc plated surface where a brightener has not been used.

If you make sure to chew your corn thoroughly then there will still be some starch granules that dont get burst open sufficiently as well, even once freed from the kernel, and those will move through undigested to feed your gut microbiota.",faxon,16,0,1666068752,isqwhhr,y6czto,1667928500,0,False,0.9468570947647096,0.6868614,arcal

Most studies have adopted a composite measure of cognitive activities and less is known about the effects of a specific activity. To engage actively in daily life, activities may differ in their corresponding cognitive tasks and the amounts of intellectual stimulation required for active engagement (Ghisletta et al., 2006). Besides, different activities might offset each other in their effects on cognitive function (Gallucci et al., 2009; Lindstrom et al., 2005; Lopes et al., 2012; Lovden et al., 2005). Research evidence for any specific activity is warranted.&gt; Reading is a typical intellectual activity. Compared with other leisure activities, such as physical and social activities, it is more sedentary and isolated. Reading for leisure has proven to have health benefits for older people in prolonging life (Jacobs et al., 2008), and cognition may mediate between reading and survival advantage (Bavishi et al., 2016).It sounds like leisure reading and even watching TV and other activities also, help.

16719,isvw7r9,askscience,"Keep in mind that, at least with Chinese languages, it’s not like a speaker has to memorize all ten thousand-and-whatever characters used in modern written Chinese, they don’t even have to memorize the vast majority. Han characters are all composed of fundamental parts called radicals, of which there are just 214, and in addition to each radical being a character onto itself with a specific meaning and pronunciation (the latter of which obviously varies between the many languages that use Han characters in their writing), all other characters are basically composites of multiple radicals together. In Chinese languages iirc, you can actually discern “hints” to both the meaning and pronunciation of any character based on which radicals (or other characters) are placed where (like I know that the one either to the left or on the top—depending on the character—is either the “semantic determinative” or “phonetic determinative”, and the ones on the right or bottom are the other determinative, but obviously I forget which is which), unless obviously the character in question *is* just one of the 214 basic radicals. This is still obviously somewhat more complex and more stuff to memorize than learning the Latin alphabet, but it means that there’s still usually a way to get some idea of what word a character represents without having to visually memorize most of a dictionary (speaking of which, there’s also a traditional ordering to the radicals, like equivalent to an alphabetic ordering, and that’s how Chinese and Japanese dictionaries are indexed if you’ve ever wondered about that).In Japanese, however, the system doesn’t quite work the same way. Japanese adapted Chinese characters for its writing, but Japanese is not only not closely related to Chinese languages, but is also just morphologically, grammatically, and typologically a really different language, so the way it uses Han characters (or *kanji*, as they are known in Japanese) is a lot more convoluted and unintuitive, two additional native Japanese syllable-based systems (both collectively known as *kana*) are needed for certain linguistic particles and other aspects of language that Chinese languages just don’t really have (like prefixes and suffixes, in that Chinese languages are very uninflected compared to Japanese), and there are certain systems for giving phonetic glosses to unfamiliar characters that even native Japanese speakers need the help of sometimes. The latter issue mostly comes from the fact that while the “semantic determinative” portion of the radicals still (mostly) holds up with Japanese use of kanji, Japanese being such a different language means that the “phonetic determinative” part usually doesn’t work except with direct Chinese loanwords (and even those can be confusing, because they were mostly adopted into Japanese from Middle Chinese, which is quite different from modern Mandarin, or really any modern Chinese language), and to make matters even worse, there are a ton of entirely different possible readings for a lot of different kanji, which is almost like the equivalent of if English was full of words that were spelled one way but could be pronounced several absolutely dissimilar ways, and sometimes not even mean quite the same thing (I guess with all the homophones/homographs in English we almost do have something a bit like this, although not nearly to the same degree). So with written Japanese, there actually is a significant amount of rote memorization and learning to recognize context that is required (which is why it’s arguably the most confusingly-written language currently in use).EDIT: oh yeah, forgot to mention, the traditional ordering of the 214 radicals is actually based on stroke count (like how many distinct strokes it takes to write each of them), from fewest to most strokes.",regular_modern_girl,2,0,1666145107,istgim6,y774y0,1667923981,0,False,0.6537342071533203,0.55156046,aphilsphan

[nobody knows](https://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/astronomy-terms/before-big-bang.htm).  The observable universe has always had stuff in it, so the size/distance/volume is measure by taking two of those points.  Physics no longer works when you are talking about a universe without particles.  There is no distance unless you are measuring how far apart two things are.  There is no pressure without having a container.Your scenario of a universe with nothing it but somehow it has reference points for scale 1m x 1m x 1m, that cant happen.  There is no way to get a reference point.Maybe the closest you will get is within [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) - it lets you have a universe without particles.  At some point the universe was a mass of 1 dimensional strings vibrating (so we dont have 3 dimension like 1m x 1m x 1m anymore).

I suppose this is far more relevant for something relatively severe, with heavy symptoms that you take days to fight. An acute infection with little symptoms is not likely to do this, but Im still dubious about saying you have more effective innate immunity during an acute infection given how common confections are too... Active inflammation also inhibits other immune functions like for formation of germinal centres, some t cell functions etc, so having extra neutrophils might help with some aspects but not others. An example is BCG vaccination (a live vaccine) induces emergency granulopoiesis which confers short term protection against bacterial sepsis, so an infectious nudge like thia to the immune system can help it in the short term but you dont want to whack it with a baseball bat (eg.

You need some scoring function to order your data elements that you want to store: some way to compare two elements, and decide which one is greater. Then you connect elements together using a special algorithm to make a tree-shaped graph. Then its fast to search for data with specific scores or score ranges, add new data elements, and remove old ones. These operations work by starting at the root of the tree and following a branch towards the leaves. Because the tree is ordered, you only need to follow one branch instead of searching across multiple branches. That means that these operations take an amount of time directly proportional to the height of the tree, or the number of steps it takes to get from the root to the furthest leaf. This is a big improvement over having to look at each data element in a list to find the one you want.For each collection of data elements there are multiple possible tree representations (depending on which data element you choose as the root), and some of these will be shorter than others.

But I can speak to some context and recent research that you or some other passers-by might find relevant to this question:Silicon is actually kind of a bad semiconductor from a performance point of view. But its extremely cheap and easy to work with, hence why most non specialised chips are silicon.As an example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) is an alloy used in RF/microwave circuits. It enables faster performance than silicon, despite larger feature sizes, but comes at a huge cost premium. We usually dont use it for digital systems so I dont know how viable this specific example would be (probably not), but if it is wed be sacrificing some of the architectural features and speedups that cramming more circuitry (therefore more transistors) allows for a sheer increase in clock rate.Research at MIT, U Houston, et al. on [cubic boron arsenide](https://news.mit.edu/2022/best-semiconductor-them-all-0721) shows high mobility of both electrons and holes (meaning less resistance for CMOS digital gates and therefore less heat outpower - specifically overcoming silicons problem with PMOS devices being higher resistance wrt aspect ratio), and high thermal conductivity (so heat can be brought out of the die faster - meaning we can handle a higher TDP in a single device without exceeding its temperature eating).This is extremely early research, so Id say its more likely to come across an unsurmountable obstacle along the way to commercialisation than succeeding at this point, statistically. But if we demonstrate good overall characteristics and are, critically, able to economically produce boluses and wafers of BAs at industrial scale, we might see it become a specialised semiconductor material on the market and have a chance at competing with silicon.",laogeodritt,28,0,1666196811,isxzwll,y83iat,1667921390,0,False,0.9394952654838562,0.61609364,salyut3

If you know that a vehicle travels at a constant speed of 60mph for two hours, you can substitute those numbers: 60mph = distance/2 hours and rearrange to find that the vehicle travelled 120 miles in that time.Algebra deals with this kind of simple equation, but also much more complicated ones. The rules can be used whether or not there are any actual numbers involved - the expressions could consist entirely of unknowns - or variables.Calculus is the manipulation and calculation of expressions involving how one variable *changes* with respect to another variable. For example, every second, the vehicles speed increases by 10mph. This relates speed to time, as the above example did, but indirectly. There are two types of calculus, differentiation (finding the derivative: the rate of change of one variable with respect to another) and integration, which is the opposite process. The speed (or better, the velocity) of an object at any moment is the derivative of the objects distance from a fixed point with respect to time: it is the rate at which distance changes with respect to time.

Intuitively you can say when x is 0, y is also 0. If x is either negative or positive, y is positive. So the min value of y is 0. That’s what Calc is. In place of figuring out a single value, we’re looking at the behavior of all values. A derivative is the rate of change of a line at a point.

17278,iu93rqv,askscience,"&gt;Dark matter has never been directly observed, ...Id like to point out here that the known neutrinos qualify as (hot) dark matter, and other than their very light mass / relativistic speeds, they have essentially identical properties to the cold dark matter that we havent yet directly observed.  So from a definitions standpoint, we *have* in fact directly observed a form of dark matter (and we regularly produce it in labs for the purpose of studying it).  The reason I mention this fact is because people seem to have a common misconception that dark matter is some kind of farfetched, esoteric hypothesis that makes it different from everything that we actually do know, when the reality is that its incredibly similar to some of the things that we do already definitely know — so similar in fact that one of the leading hypotheses for a cold dark matter particle candidate is in fact a heavy neutrino.&gt;... to my knowledge there isnt even strong evidence of where its located. So the certainty of statements like dark matter has no coherent motion I think needs some caveats.Id now also like to point out just how overwhelming the evidence for dark matter is.  Contrary to what youve said, we do in fact have *multiple* ways to measure the bulk properties and behavior of dark matter with enough sensitivity to narrow in on its locations, densities, velocity distribution, speed distribution, etc.  This sort of evidence comes from about a dozen completely independent metrics:* Galaxy rotation curves* Velocity dispersions of stars in galaxies* Gravitational lensing and microlensing surveys* X-ray spectra from gas-heavy galaxy clusters* The angular power spectrum of the CMB* The matter power spectrum and rates of structure formation in the early universe* Observations of more than a dozen colliding galaxy clusters, including the Bullet Cluster, Abell 520, NGC 1052-DF2, and many others* Reconciling type Ia supernova distance measurements with the observed flatness of the universes shape* Galaxy redshift surveys* Spectral measurements of the Lyman-Alpha forest for distant galaxies... and there are even more things not mentioned in this list as well.  What really drives the nail home is that all of these completely independent metrics are all in close agreement as to exactly how much dark matter there is, how it is distributed, and what most all of its bulk properties and behavior are.  When you have such a wealth of evidence where all of it is unequivocably pointing toward the same explanation ... theres just no reasonable excuse to deny it.It may be true that we havent *directly* detected individual cold dark matter particles, but that doesnt mean we havent detected the direct consequences of the existence of cold dark matter in bulk.  The various observational signals supporting the existence of cold dark matter are clear, robust, and all consistent with each other.  Among honest researchers as well as honest laypeople who have an interest in science, there really can be no doubt that dark matter exists and has all of the properties that weve undisputably discovered it to have.Edit: think about it like this.  Many hundreds of years ago, people didnt know what the mechanism underlying fire was.  Some people postulated the existence of a light, flammable fluid inside most forms of matter called phlogiston; others sought out different alchemic explanations.  At the time, nobody knew what fire actually was at a microscopic level; they didnt know about oxygen, combusion, or chemistry in general.  But do you think *anybody* working on the problem at the time would have denied the existence of fire?  Of course not — all you had to do was rub some sticks together to prove that fire clearly existed!  You dont need to have a microscopic understanding of fire in order to know with certainty that fire exists, because you can clearly see the bulk behavior of fire with your own eyes.  The situation is similar with dark matter, today:  we may not know what its microscopic description is yet, but we can see the macroscopic evidence very clearly with our various telescopes and instruments that are designed for making precision measurements of the cosmos.  The evidence we see for dark matters existence is quite clear and undeniable.",forte2718,168,0,1667055101,iu8saa5,ygfptx,1667862994,0,False,0.8988530039787292,0.75417686,elite4koga

17314,isynviz,askscience,"Lets say you had a `table` (aka, an array of mixed type data/a database) and frequently you wanted to do some similar operations on them. Say, you often wanted to concatenate them (aka, stack one on top of the other, so that they were combined into a single table), well then you could, for ease, overload the `+` operator, so that the `table1 + table2` concatenated the tables together. Or perhaps each of your tables contained information about the same people who were doing something like picking fruit on a day by day basis. Something like each row of the table included the name of the person, how many apples they picked, how many peaches they picked, and how many limes they picked. Then, if you wanted to see how many each person picked over a several day period, you could overload the `+` operator to look through the tables, and add together the number of apples from the same person (this way, the tables dont have to be sorted in the same order) and create a new table, so that `table1 + table2` was a table that had all of the people work picked fruit on either day, with their totals from both days added together. This just allows code to look neater, and be easier to read and understand. Overloading comparison operators allows you to do your normal conditional checks on complex data types. Continuing with our example above with the table holding fruit picking statistics, say you want to be able to know if more fruit was picked on one day or the other. You could overload the `&lt;` and `&gt;` signs to add up all of the fruit picked in a table, and compare them. That way you could say `if table1 &lt; table2` and it would actually be comparing all of the fruit picked as stored in `table1` and comparing it to `table2`",weed_o_whirler,9,0,1666201260,isygsrr,y83iat,1667921055,0,False,0.961470663547516,0.745156,mrperiodniceguy

17345,isyfigg,askscience,"Our Human circadian system (and most vertebrates and many inverts, though often through different biological mechanisms) is completely governed by light availability. Light presence degrades a protein that is a part of our circadian “clock”, and sets a rhythm that tells us to sleep. You can set a circadian rhythm in humans with just an hour of light exposure at the beginning and end of the day time. Interestingly, hibernation and different types of torpor (prolonged moments of rest) are totally unlinked to the circadian system, which solely governs our sleep based on the position of sun in the sky/daylight. When you think about it, that makes sense - they often go into burrows, where sunlight reaches very little. Hibernation is actually more so linked to cold; though whether that’s a direct link to cold or a result of decreased nutrient availability varies between species. It been shown that some species at the very least actually are able to complete shut down their circadian system from functioning during hibernation to prevent interference with the two systems. A really interesting part of animal life in the arctic circle though is that not all species hibernate. Arctic reindeer, which don’t hibernate, have been observed to have a much less controlling circadian system compared to closely related, non arctic species. They’ve essentially shut off their circadian system as an adaptation to maintain essential biological needs throughout the day. They are able to graze periodically every few hours throughout the day as their body needs, even without the presence of sunlight. They do still have higher prevalence of melatonin during the night, which indicates that they can still denote when the seasons change, but it’s not linked to a distinct sleep period, unlike other ruminates. Unfortunately, that is an adaptation to the environment that would take generations and generations to arise in a species randomly, and as humans are relatively new to the arctic environment in an evolutionary sense, that adaptation has not been observed yet in native human populations of the arctic. Humans are still beholden to the circadian system in the arctic, meaning that in periods of full dark there is more pressure to sleep in a free running period of 25 hours. Also, because is was mentioned, the 25 hour free running period you spoke of (free running means the natural period of sleep observed in no-light conditions) is something that has been observed in many species. It’s not actually odd like you said, because when you arrive at the mechanic behind it the answer makes sense. The link is that it’s only present in diurnal (active during the day) species. Nocturnal species tend to have a 23 hour free running period. Because the protein that signals sleep degrades in light, and that degradation takes time, this allows diurnal and nocturnal animals to be awake at the right time when entrained to the sunlight, sometime around daybreak and sometime after sunset respectively. Theoretically in some exoplanet that might have a 20 hour day, species that evolved there with the same circadian rhythms would have a 21 and 19 hour free running period because of that.",redmonkees,136,0,1666198011,iswqedt,y7s95g,1667921301,0,False,0.8569625616073608,0.8312536,theuturn2yz

This was in the early 17th century and led to the widespread adoption of logarithms.He was trying to develop an easier, mechanical way to multiply numbers. He first developed what are called [Napiers Bones][NB] which allow one to do multiplication by simply sliding rods relative to one another. Napiers Bones do not actually use logarithms - they are kind of just fancy multiplication tables - but he then realized that he could compile logarithm tables. To use a log table for multiplication or division, you first use the table to look up the log of both numbers. Then you add for multiplication or subtract for division. Finally, you use the table backwards to get the final answer. Because adding and subtracting are so easy, this actually saves time compared to doing long multiplication or long division, even with the three table lookups.Shortly thereafter, [slide rules][SR] were invented to make this process mechanical; a slide rule is simply a set of metal rods printed with a log scale ruler. I like to think that the slide rule fully realized Napiers vision by combining his two important innovations.

They still used artificial light, which disrupted the degradation of proteins in the circadian clock which normally would signal you to sleep during periods of darkness. They essentially deprived their bodies of sleep by extending the period where the signal to stay up (light) was present. While a 48 hour period can be entrained, biological assays have shown that there is still a biologically maintained free running period of around 25 hours throughout the body. This is present in almost all diurnal organisms (organisms that are active during the day). Nocturnal organisms tend to have a free running period closer to 23 hours. Both of these have been observed in environments completely devoid of all light, and also in blind humans with complete enucleation (lack of eyeballs), who are unable to have any photo reception. The 48 hour period works because it is a natural multiple of 24, and allows some synchronicity with biological functions throughout the body that were determined by the 25 hour free running circadian clock. While we can function under those conditions, and will entrain to that period, by no means is our biological determined sleep cycle specifically 48 hours.",redmonkees,18,0,1666199498,isy81q6,y7s95g,1667921188,0,False,0.9884815216064452,0.6886248,impossibly_curious

You can scale something by 3 and it gets 3 times as big. So (drawing rudimentary vectors) we can see this as -&gt; going to ---&gt;. But you can also scale it by -1 and you just mirror it through the origin: -&gt; goes to &lt;-. The funny thing about this is that if you scale by *x* and then scale by *y*, you are essentially scaling by *x* * *y*. Hence, you can think of multiplication as concatenating the scaling operations. (This is also a nice reason why -1 * -1 = 1: If you mirror something twice you get back the same thing!)Now what if we were to add rotation into the mix? We might want numbers to represent both scaling *and* rotation - keeping the property that multiplication is the same as concatenating the transformations. We would expect that there is some mystery number *a* such that if you scale by *a*, the size of the arrow stays the same, but the direction just rotates by 90 degrees. Now what happens if we scale by *a* twice? Well, then were flipping by 90 degrees twice, so in total we rotate over 180 degrees. And if you think about it, if you rotate something by 180 degrees, this is the same as mirroring it through the origin: -&gt; goes to &lt;-. So our mystery number *a* now has the property that if you do it twice - that is to say, *a* * *a* - the result is mirroring through the origin, which is exactly what -1 does! So, *a^2 = -1*. Of course usually we call it *i* instead of *a*. This idea of using complex numbers to represent rotation is a very common use of them, particularly in trigonometry. However, its not the only way they are used, and in particular it doesnt explain why you can add them as well as multiplying them. But I hope it *does* demystify how you can have something that, when you square it, gives back -1.

Influenza is recombinant, meaning different viruses can swap out sections of genome with each other.

H and N refer to the most important surface proteins, and the numbers are the specific variety.  Within each variety there are tons and tons of mutation versions.  So if you have an H-mutant virus and an N-mutant virus that seem to be doing well on their own, they may combine to become even more infectious.  If you have two H-mutants, they are much less likely to suddenly become a problem unless they can find an N-mutation that is more infectious or more dangerous.Note that they can also recombine with animal (eg pig or bird) strains, not just humans.  Its not that it jumps species so much that it can potentially combine two dangerous aspects- the H protein may be dangerous in all species, but the N protein may be holding it back.  If it picks up a human-compatible N protein, suddenly were in trouble.  We know this is how a lot of the more recent big waves of influenza happened, like H1N1.Influenza mutates faster than covid even *without* recombination, but covid is SO infectious and immunity is *still* not widespread enough to keep up with mutations that are relatively small.

Look for instance at all types of numbers a programming language has: Integers, long integers, floats, rationals, etc. Each of these types of numbers has its own version of +. But all these distinct(!) functions are written using the same +. And thats very useful! Say for instance I wanted to make a function that takes a list of numbers and returns it sum.

So, I can use that + to sum up all the elements of the list. Note that theres more sneaky overloading here: I dont have to explicitly state this is the list with no Floats or this is the list with no Rationals, even though the empty list of Floats is a list of Floats, and the empty list of Rationals is a list of Rationals - which are *different objects*.

That energizing causes the the RGC to send a neural pulse, called an action potential to a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located near the hypothalamus. Now, interestingly while RGCs do play a role in sight, this specific pathway to the SCN is different than the pathway to the optical cortex(which is at the back of the head, not near the hypothalamus), and is why some blind people can still respond to light and maintain a circadian rhythm without being able to actually see or process what they are seeing. Now, this is complex and it’s been a minute since I studied the specific pathway, so I’ll explain it incredibly simply. Once the action potential reaches the SCN, it innervates cells there, which is where the proteins I mentioned are created.

17817,it0xyc7,askscience,"The other answer about the geometric nature of complex multiplication is good, but theres a bit more that makes the complex numbers so nice. It all really comes down to the multiplication in the end though. One thing is that calculus with complex numbers ends up very qualitatively different from real-valued calculus. The root of that is that complex differentiability is a much stronger condition. Whereas a function of a real variable is differentiable if its differentiable on the left and right, a function of a complex variable must be differentiable from every direction on the plane. This ends up meaning that complex-differentiable functions are very rigidly determined (globally!) by their behavior in a small number of points, unlike real-differentiable functions which can be smoothly bent and perturbed. This ends up meaning that complex-differentiable functions are all analytic, i.e. equal to their power series representation, and therefore are represented by a relatively small amount of data (a countable sequence of coefficients). This makes a lot of problems involving complex differentiable functions deceptively tractable compared to their real cousins, and so complex numbers become a natural setting for many theories involving continuous functions.Theres more-- the complex numbers are the smallest algebraically closed field extension of the real numbers, so they admit a lot of nice theorems and algorithms require you to pick a root of the given polynomial. This makes them natural in many algebraic settings involving the real numbers. A subfield of the complex numbers, the algebraic closure of the rationals, is another common field in algebra.And still more-- the nice analytic and algebraic properties are both relevant to the theory of complex *manifolds*, which is the study of shapes and spaces modelled on the complex plane like a sphere is modelled on the regular Euclidean plane. These manifolds are often studied by virtue of the spaces of functions on and between them, and the rigid structure of complex analytic functions therefore transfers to a rigid topological and geometric structure.

You have the force of the atmosphere pushing on it from the top and sides, you have the force of gravity pulling it down, and you also have whats called a normal force that is the ground pushing upwards just enough that to cancel out the gravity/atmosphere pushing it down.You could take these forces and up them to a level to squish the metal down, however, this would be more like melting the metal and turning it into a liquid than proving that solid are highly viscus liquids.To prove this, imagine that instead of a cube, we have a really tall steel pole. On a high gravity planet, it will experience a lot of downwards force and likely collapse if its not strong enough. For the sake of simplicity, say it folds in the middle and collapses.If you feel the fold, itll likely be warm from the partially melted steel, which is really just heat released from the broken molecule structures that make up the steel. (You can sort of simulate this with a paper clip, if you bend it back and forth rapidly,. youll feel it get warm. This is energy being released from molecular bonds making up the clip, and if you do it enough times, youll end up breaking enough of the bonds the break the clip apart.)So I guess a simple way to break down the difference is that a liquid will freely try to lower its energy (go to a lower point like water flowing), even if that means deforming its shape.

In a very oversimplified model its like a simple switch: normally the organism would develop into one sex but if there are certain genes *present and active*, they produce proteins which lead to those processes being shut off and the development of the other sex being initiated. Usually theres a main sex determining gene which causes a domino effect of many other genes being turned on and off.  So there are basically 2 ways to determine sex: the familiar way is that one sex posesses these genes and the other simply doesnt, this is achieved by placing them on sex chromosomes (X and Y in mammals, Z and W in birds, etc.) Since the chromosomes you pass onto your child are determined randomly, enviromental factors play largely no role here. Of course in reality its a lot more complicated.    The other way is that both sexes have all the genes - there are no special sex chromosomes - but theyre only active in one of them. This can happen based on enviromental factors, afterall your body activates and deactivates genes based on whats happening all the time: for example if you have low blood sugar, genes coding for hunger hormones are activated, genes coding for insulin are turned down, etc and once you eat something and your blood sugar rises its reversed.

Maybe one of the balls is .01% smaller in volume, or has a scratch on it, or I write A and B on the balls, or whatever. You cant do anything like that with identical particles; I can say theres an electron at position A and an electron at position B, but I waved a magic wand and swapped them (or exchanged them) the physical situation would be exactly the same.Now it turns out that on a technical level, there are actually two ways to accomplish this. The obvious way is that if I have a wavefunction that describes my system, its symmetric under exchange of the two particles, i.e. ψ(b1, b2) = ψ(b2, b1). If this is the case, the identical particles are called bosons.But it turns out that theres actually a *second* way to accomplish this, because anything you can physically measure involves *two* wavefunctions. Instead, you can have ψ(f1, f2) = -ψ(f2, f1), and then when you compute the result of any measurement its still unchanged because itll just be multiplied by a factor of (-1)^2 =1. Particles like this are antisymmetric under exchange and are called fermions.This whole symmetry or antisymmetry of the wavefunction under exchange of the particles ends up having physical consequences.

Depending on details of the bond strength, temperature, and lattice, atoms at the surface can be free to hop from one lattice point to another.  This isnt even really a dislocation - its a defect-free crystal in the initial and final state.  In the presence of gravity, there is a net loss of energy if the  atom moves down compared to moving up.  How long it takes for the crystal to droop / settle depends on a lot of factors, but its incorrect to say *never*.  Especially given the phrasing of the question.   Youve arbitrarily chosen to define the viscosity of pitch as highly viscous liquid but you ignore the possibility of materials with a viscosity 10 orders of magnitude higher than pitch, which I think is what OP really means with this question.I used to work with a crystalline material that fell into this category.

Part of the problem is I learned this stuff over 25 years ago, and while the *concepts* arent really any different than they were then, most learners want practical programming examples to go along with those concepts, and that stuff has changed a lot.For example probably the most influential book for me as a young programmer was *Ruminations in C++* by Koenig and Moo, but I read it way back in the last millennium, and a lot of the code it uses would be considered very bad practice today. (Not because they didnt know better back then, but because the C++ language itself has changed a lot.)So... I did a little bit of googling and found a very new book called *Data Structures the Fun Way* by Jeremy Kubica. The authors credentials look pretty good. I have an OReilly Books subscription through work so was able to look at it a bit. I checked out the chapter on binary search trees. It seems like a decent book, but the writing is a bit stuffier than I shot for, with some mild dad-jokes put in. (For example it notes that botany purists might notice that CS folks draw trees upside-down, and an example is a HR department tracking the humor level of employees.)One example of the stuffier writing: At this point, we can make definitive statements about the remaining search space underneath the current node. Theres nothing wrong with that sentence, its just not... *conversational*, ya know?But heres an example thats pretty similar to what I wrote:&gt;At each step, we determine whether to explore the left or right subtree by comparing the value at the current node with the target value. If the target value is less than the current value, the search progresses to the left. If the target value is greater than the current value, the search progresses to the right.Its followed by a practical analogy:&gt;The nodes value thus serves the same function as those helpful signs in hotels that tell us rooms 500-519 are to the left and rooms 520-590 are to the right. With one quick check, we can make the appropriate turn and ignore the rooms in the other direction.I havent read more than a few pages, but it looks to me to be worth checking out.

But, generally, the ways that languages in contact influence each other depends on the nature and frequency of their interaction. Its also going to depend on how speakers of Ukrainian feel about the Russian language itself (in contrast to how they feel about the Russian government, army, etc). If they associate the Russian language with occupiers, its very reasonable to expect them to strengthen their resistance to it.A few examples of that happening historically:1. after Icelands independence from Denmark, there was a concerted effort to remove Danish features from the Icelandic language.2. after the American Revolution, the same happened with American and British English. Webster, whose school grammar book became standard, intentionally made changes to help make American English distinct from British English: removing the u from words like colour/color; reversing the -re in words like theatre/theater; etc.3. the same happened with English and French during the 100 Year wars. In fact, thats one of the main reasons English still exists. It had declined in use after the Norman Conquest, but was revived in the 1300s, for a number of reasons. Henry IV was actually the first King of England since the Conquest to speak English as his native language. Some of the earlier kings didnt speak English at all.Without a negative response to the use of the Russian language, the two are somewhat related, and depending on the level of contact between them (which I suspect is high), there could be longer term influence. That influence usually operates at three basic levels: words, sounds, structure. (meaning, first wed see shared word use and/or word borrowing; then sounds, then sentence structures/grammar like word order, methods of negation (how you say not), etc.That longer term response is both natural and a more likely reaction if say, Russia were to conquer Ukraine and make an effort to replace Ukrainian with Russian, or if the war is short lived, they resolve their problems, and the interactions between the two languages basically continue as before.",poluscoeus,2,0,1666300156,ir6mf4s,xwbf66,1667914982,0,False,0.9965311288833618,0.74186647,reasonable_riot

A 2x2x2 cube has a 3d volume of 8, rather than an _area_ of 8.  It has a surface area too, 4*6 or 24 (the area of all its sides).  A 2x2x2x2 hypercube has a _4d_ volume of 16, but thats not the same as the 3d volume in the same way that 3d volume isnt the same as area.  The 3d surface volume equivalent is the volume of its 8 component cubes, or 64.  So you cant really say the volume is the same in different dimensions because its a different _kind_ of volume, in the same way that length is different from area is different from 3d volume.  The other thing that I think is tripping you up is that you are comparing volumes with side of 2 to volumes with side of i.  1 and i are more comparable.  A line with length 1 has a length of 1.  I square with side length one has an area of 1x1, or 1.  A cube with side length one has a volume of 1x1x1, or 1.  A n dimensional hypercube has an n-dimensional volume of 1^n, aka 1.

I.e. Arachnophobia (or most fears, really). Herd mentality can likewise cause humans to behave hilarious; Theres been experiments showcasing this, such as placing some actors in an elevator, back-facing the entrance. Any other person that entered would join them in staring at the back side of the elevator, regardless of the fact that was highly impractical for using that elevator, and utterly pointless. But its simply instinct to imitate what other humans are doing, even if the action doesnt make any rational sense (instead of, as would be proper, to question whether there is an actual reason for performing that action).Theres also a lot of less-clear examples of instinctive behaviors screwing with us: i.e. over-patternization; Our brains developed two ways to deal with situations: The first is active analysis, which is high in energy-cost, but allows us to make complex deductions. The other is passive repetition, which is extremely quick and energy-efficient, but can only do what we have already established. I.e. driving/riding to work/school on autopilot. Its a neat trick by which we can combine high intelligence with moderated energy consumption. But it also generates a problem, in that the brain will try to aggressively patternize EVERYTHING, in order to turn it into a low-level automated behavior. This means you brain will actively try to class, stereotype, simplify, automate everything it can. Which can lead to, as implied, unjustified stereotypes or in fact oversimplifying problems. This again is a cornerstone of Populism, which tries to stimulate the brain of listeners into simplifying complex societal problems into seemingly simple (but factually incorrect) answers.So, from these examples alone: Dont, for one second, believe that we humans arent also animals with very daft instincts. The only thing that differentiates us from *most* (not even *all*) animals, is that our consciousnesses have developed to a point where we *can* (not always will) actively recognize when an instinct is kicking in, and *might* be even able to actively suppress it in favor of a cognitive choice.",alblaka,57,0,1666347173,it69ts1,y9a6rk,1667912511,0,False,0.8706638216972351,0.40044153,yashaastora

This information input then over time leads to the damn building behavior because it creates a selection pressure where beavers who build dams survive and reproduce more.In a lot of ways you could look at our own sapience as the same as beaver dam building behavior.  Pattern recognition likely allowed us to develop sapience by giving us the ability to make predictions about the future based of previous information.  Overtime this could have allowed us to be able to create models of or environment that do not correspond with our current environment (imagination).  At some point in the process sapience arose.  This, for obvious reasons, turned out to be an extraordinarily advantages trait for almost any environment.  So our ancestors with these traits survived more easily and passed those traits on.As some people will likely attest, we sometimes blindly think about things for no reason.

19195,it76e5c,askscience,"Natural selection via reproduction of genetic material. A group of mammals that carried this gene that coded for this response to running water reproduced and passed on this gene (along with the rest of their genetic material). “Beavers” eventually evolved. It’s important to not view their existence in isolation from other dam-building mammals. Although their behaviour seems peculiar now, other mammals will have done it in the past. That beavers do it now is simply because animals that did it in the past passed the gene down successfully.Evidence suggests beavers don’t build dams because they enjoy it, but because running water precipitates the influx of potential predators in their environments. Big pike eat baby beavers for example. If there are pike around, there are probably other fish around too, and if there are lots of fish around, there are probably bears and wolves not far away either - which are apex predators in the beaver’s ecosystem. Dam-building is therefore an auditory response to running water that contributes to the survival of the species carrying the gene that codes for it. Dam-building helped animals carrying the gene for it to survive. Beavers are around now because the genes responsible for building dams have helped them survive. If a group of beavers were forced out of their aquatic environments, the genes coding for this behaviour would become less and less useful to their offspring, and their offspring’s offspring, ad infinitum. Different genes would become more useful to this group. This is a very rudimentary explanation about how speciation occurs. Speciation involves the interactions between animals’ genetic material and their environments. Those best adapted to their environments survive to pass their own genes on. Thanks Darwin!Why and how there has actually come about genetic material that causes a response in animals to running water that makes them build dams, I have no idea. I suspect it is not genetic material too dissimilar from that which incites birds to build nests, or even that provokes humans to build shelters",404errorabortmistake,8,0,1666357078,it6xipa,y9a6rk,1667912045,0,False,0.9138836860656738,0.3677626,oodood

That means being able to put words together and predict what the end result will be. That might be distinctive wording or the cumulative meaning, etc. Its more about the mental math required to have a composite. We know this because the FOXP2 gene is also used in tool-making, specifically knapping. Which is how you get spear heads and stone age tools. This process is very difficult and requires you to be able to predict how the stone will flake away. You have to be able to calculate angles visually and match your hand-eye coordination to achieve that result, many many times. It takes a while. This super-difficult skill is what we believe trained early homo groups (including Neanderthals) . Lastly, we know that the culture of early homo groups was deeply spiritual. We know that shared identity was very important and that many early humans traveled in small family unit groups of 4-6 people. Early humans were prolific travelers and managed to explore the globe, leaving behind the nearly universal image of a religious carving. If I recall, it was an animal totem or some small vaguely humanoid sculpture, kind of like Venus of Willendorf. Basically, anthropologists never see anything that truly universal--because variety is the rule. But we found enough of these sculptures around the ancient world, all identical, all depicting shared group identity (humankind etc). This keepsake was traded globally, but also carried with many groups. From this, we know that their culture valued something even more than survival.

And if the system cant isolate this malicious player, it will be prioritized by default, host reproductive machinery is hijacked via efficiency or rather simplicity of the virus.It is also clear that the metabolic state of the cell plays a significant role when it comes to lethality.Energy for the ejection is sourced from the packaging process, where and when the packaging of a certain number of nucleotides is compensated with the consumption of ATP, motor proteins shove the chain inside partially/fully constructed precursor of the capsid.The formation of capsid can be looked at as a polymerization process, each capsid being the final product of maturation, and for polymerization, certain concentrations of ions and capsomeres are necessary when concentration is reached, the reaction between matching capsomeres occurs ( around base protein in some cases ).The number of precursors and free or clustered capsomers during maturation is unique for each phage because of their symmetry and characteristics, I believe its even possible to measure it via the viscosity and permeability of the cytoplasm. When it comes to energy conservation within the capsid, water plays a major role, as water is the source of DNA rigidity... So if the water structure is ruined some of the trapped ions may be diluted or replaced, reducing the efficiency of this individual phage.But there is some evidence suggesting that phages infecting the host ( during ejection) can collectively reduce the threshold for infection by displacing water from the host...

19825,itcgcee,askscience,"I find this answer the most explaining, yet its missing one thing.People speak like, predators can learn what to eat and what not to eat, like with taste. But it has nothing to do with this. Because, the learned experience cannot pass to new generation. It would require the poison to be non-fatal, and the species of predator would have to be intelligent enough, so they could teach it. And still, some variants of predators might just try and like the experience, due to having mutations on their tasting receptors. So, how did they co-evolved?Probably, once upon a time, predators who hunted those creatures varied by their instinct or senses of hunting creatures with specific shapes or colors, and those who liked eating colorful things died more and more often due to colorful preys containing more and more fatal poisons. This led to survival and production of those more who dont prefer eating colorful preys, and those who are more colorful preys (they are actually not preys anymore at this point).Yet, time to time some mutations can give arise to the old variants of predators who liked to hunt colorful creatures, but they would keep dying, so their population in the pool would be neglected. On the other hand, if some mutations would create a prey that are colorful yet not poisonous now, it might increase its number in the genetic pool easily for at least some time due to predators not eating them anyway. But such mutations must be rare, and variants on the predators side might eventually balance things back to this current state.So, it may have a secret wave function in the background, which, things tend to converge towards this current state every time they deviate a little, rather than going the opposite direction, due to the path on the opposite direction being way longer compared to the current state of things (that is colorful being fatal). So, things must have been kinda locked down into this state.Last but not least, its amazing how its not even about only one species of prey and one species of predator, but among many species of preys and predators. It must be due to many species hunting the same prey, and many species being hunted by the same predator.By the way, everything above is kind of my prediction of how things happened and keep happening.",mayonnace,2,0,1666454999,itc6yhl,yakntt,1667906554,0,False,0.9277341961860656,0.7279659,8esix

They sometimes fail to find their way back to the right one and arent rejected, at least not always:&gt;Beekeepers are usually aware that colonies at the ends of rows often ‘accumulate’ bees that have drifted when returning to the hive. In shared association apiaries some crafty beekeepers will site their colonies at the ends of rows to take advantage of the ‘generosity’ of other colonies. However, many beekeepers probably do not appreciate the extent to which drifting occurs. Pfeiffer and Crailsheim (1998) report that 13-42% of the population of a colony are ‘alien’ i.e. have drifted from adjacent hives, depending upon the time of season. Remember that drifting occurs in both directions simultaneously, so the overall numbers of bees in a colony may not be adversely affected (or boosted). In other studies Sekulja and colleagues (2014) showed that ~1% of marked bees drifted between colonies over a three day observation window. Interestingly, American foulbrood (AFB) infected bees drifted slightly more than uninfected bees. Spread of foulbroods during drifting is one reason the bee inspectors check nearby apiaries when there is an outbreak. These studies were all on workers where drifting primarily occurs during orientation flights before the bees become foragers.

20338,ith6uce,askscience,"Great reply! I just want to “yes-and” on your comment if that’s ok. I think a lot of people mis-imagine what’s happening when a caterpillar molts into a chrysalis. A lot of people think what happens is that the caterpillar builds the pupa around itself, and then the caterpillar structures break down inside that new structure and turn into the butterfly. It’s actually sort of the opposite. The parts that will form the pupa form inside the caterpillar, and the caterpillar exoskeleton gets shed off, revealing the pupa (or chrysalis) underneath. So if you cut into a pupa, of course you won’t find a caterpillar! The exoskeleton was shed off, and the interior structures have all been replaced by the adult structures. Some (but not all) caterpillar innards get broken down, like the digestive system, but all the exterior structures were sloughed off. And a tiny note - the cuticle of the chrysalis isn’t really supporting the pupal structures underneath. It’s actually produced by them as a protective shell, after they’ve already grown into shape.Edit re your edit: the Scientific American description is really nice but one thing is important to note. Most of what it describes is happening during and in the minutes immediately after the chrysalis forms.

20467,iti4kfz,askscience,"We’ll for Jungian therapy, also known as analytical/ depth psychology, it’s very much a wholistic (and I really hate using that word but here it applies) approach.First we have to understand Jung’s model of the psyche.It’s very different from Freuds model and even contemporary models of the psyche. For Freud, and therefore contemporaries, the psyche is viewed like a hydraulic machine. You have inputs one way and outputs the other way.For Jung, the psyche is to be treated as a living fact. The psyche works in ways beyond our conscious inputs, and although Freud too recognised the unconscious, Jung’s unconscious is much more fleshed out. Again,  the psyche according to Jung, is a complete and unified entity. We do not merely repress things into our unconscious, although this can and DOES happen. You can view the unconscious as an observer just as you,  the ego, are the conscious observer. The unconscious watches your actions, and thoughts and basically everything else you notice during waking life.When we dream,  the boundaries between consciousness and unconsciousness are blurred and the unconscious contents reveal themselves in the dream. Jung thought the dream served a compensatory function to the waking attitude. Meaning that whatever your dispositions are during the day,  the unconscious seeks balance through the narrative content of the dream. For Jung, the dream is attempting to convey a message to the person, but because the dream world is within the domain of the unconscious, the message is often cryptic and not straightforward in its meanings. Again this is very different from Freud (and contemporary psychologists) who thought that dreams were purposefully cryptic in order to *hide* information about the person, from the person.So back to therapy. Jungian therapy is not for everyone,  typically those who are higher in openness find refuge in this school of thought, whereas those who are low in openness but extremely conscientious, for example might very well and often do benefit from traditional Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.Jungian therapy typically involves some form of dream journaling and respective interpretations in tandem with the therapist. It is very patient led in the sense that we are trying to tune ourselves to the messages and disturbances of the unconscious contents.

20477,iti2x2f,askscience,"You’ve brought up something really interesting actually! There’s a bunch of research with a number of ideas about why exercise is so helpful with depression. Exercise upregulates neurogenesis, which basically means make it work better or more efficiently or at a faster/more optimal rate. One of the ways this happens is by endorphin production— endorphins are released in the brain after you exercise, and adult hippocampal progenitors (basically pre-neuron cells in the hippocampus, like a Pokémon that hasn’t evolved yet lol) will bind to those endorphins, which dramatically increases the amount of neurogenesis and therefore creates way more new neurons than if there wasn’t any endorphins around to influence them. There’s also theories around vascular endothelial growth factors, which are proteins in your blood that trigger the creation of new blood vessels. After exercising, there’s a much higher concentration of these proteins in your blood, which means more blood vessels can be created. It’s theorized that new neurons develop in the areas where these microscopic vessels grow in the brain (which would make sense, since vessels = blood = oxygen + nutrients), so having more of these proteins in your blood might allow for more vessels, meaning more places for new neurons to grow, which means more neurogenesis and reduced depression. There’s also brain-derived neurotrophic factors (neuro meaning brain/neuron, troph meaning nutrient) which are another kind of protein that’s increased after we exercise. These proteins are those building blocks I mentioned in my first reply, how they’re kind of like the nutrients that allow a new neuron to grow and survive. These proteins specifically are interesting because even though we don’t have great evidence that they themselves upregulate neurogenesis, research seems to show that they are an important factor in whether or not a new neuron will survive for the long term. (Another potential cause of depression could be that someone has really efficient/good neurogenesis, but perhaps those neurons die off quickly and don’t stick around long enough to make a noticeable difference in how the person feels.) So with exercising increasing the amount of these proteins in the blood, they will be able to “feed” new growing neurons so that they can stick around for a long time and create beneficial pathways, etc. So the more we exercise, the more we create proteins that create new microscopic vessels in the brain, which become the birthplace of new neurons, and those neurons develop with the help of other proteins that are also more plentiful after exercise, which help them work better and live longer!There is also a potential role for serotonin all of this too, which is less understood… I apologize if this is convoluted— Exercise increases the amount of a specific enzyme (that is important in the production of serotonin) in a specific part of the brain that produces a ton of serotonin-responsive neurons, and those neurons communicate directly with the hippocampus (where we see neurogenesis). So with more exercise, we make more enzymes to create serotonin in a part of the brain which uses a ton of serotonin to communicate with the hippocampus, which could potentially influence the neurogenesis going on there. There’s also research about white matter integrity, glucose regulation, cytokine production and other neuroinflammation systems… but that’s much more complicated to explain. Something important to note, as well, is that none of this exists in a vacuum. What I mean by that, is everything in the body works together and influences everything else, nothing works in isolation. There’s trillions of cellular processes going on at all times, and we’ve barely scratched the surface! So the more we learn about even one niche section of this stuff, the more that changes how we understand the rest of this stuff, because everything in the body is acting on each other and regulating each other and being affected by each other, especially when we talk about the brain/nervous system. So it’s never as easy as just adding a single missing element and fixing one cellular process, everything affects everything else and theres always a consequence/side effect every time we try to adjust or fix something.

That’s why I tried to use words like “might” and “could” and “assume,” because all of this is still very new and the science is always changing, and it’s extremely difficult to ever claim something as an objective fact. Serotonin is somewhat tangentially involved (I went into more detail on another reply) but the point I wanted to make was that SSRIs work, just not for the reason we thought. SSRIs do inhibit reuptake of serotonin (meaning serotonin is outside of the neuron for longer and can therefore “work” for longer), but SSRIs also work on other brain cells to do other things that seem to be a better explanation for how they help people with depression. These conclusions came about because there were a number of problems with the serotonin theory, primarily the question of why they don’t work for everybody, or why people need to try different kinds of SSRIs in order to feel better. They all inhibit reuptake of serotonin, so if depression was just that serotonin wasn’t “getting the job done” and “needed more time to work” then SSRIs should theoretically work for everyone with depression. But they still work for lots of people, so the question was how and why. Then researchers noticed that SSRIs also act on other brain cells called glial cells, not just neurons. There’s as many as 50 glial cells for every single neuron in the brain, and for a long time it was assumed that they were just structural rather than functional, but now we know that they do have very important roles in brain functioning. One type of glial cell called astrocytes have highly specific receptors that SSRIs can interact with, which allows the astrocyte to create more “growth factor” proteins that are essential for neurogenesis. Increasing serotonin itself doesn’t create more growth factors. But different SSRIs interact differently with astrocytes (and with neurons), and really the only way they’re similar (and the reason they’re grouped together as SSRIs) is because they also all inhibit serotonin reuptake. For example, amitriptyline (brand name Elavil) works directly on astrocytes to produce more FGF2 proteins, which are proteins that regulate neurogenesis and have shown to produce anti-depressant effects when there’s a greater concentration of them. But fluoxetine (Prozac) doesn’t have the same affect on astrocytes. But Prozac still works great for lots of people, so perhaps it works on astrocytes to produce a different protein that also regulates neurogenesis and creates anti-depressant effects. So I guess the take home point is that we currently assume that SSRIs work because taking them leads to more neurogenesis rather than because they increase your serotonin, and they all work a little bit differently from one another, but we don’t really have a way to figure out which cellular adjustment you need, like if you’d benefit from more BDNF proteins or FGF2 proteins, etc. Maybe one day we’ll be able to determine which SSRI would be the best one for the patient without having to just try a bunch to see what works.",catharcissism,18,0,1666559841,ithu4md,ybkwq2,1667900623,0,False,0.9755025506019592,0.7677551,redditlloyd

If thats the case, then depression and neurogenesis rates should be negatively correlated - which seems strange and incomplete given the growing rates of depression among adolescents. Neurogenesis alone is neutral - *how* those neurons are integrated into mental activity is *crucial*. Frankly, BDNF and other neurogenesis markers seem to be a response more than stimulus, like hey stuff is different in how this works, we better adapt. Cannabis also increases BDNF and neurogenesis in the hippocampus - yet can aid or worsen depression depending on other factors.**I import from other scientists a more robust explanation: anxiety and/or depression most often result from an excess of uncertainty in a patients life situation.** There may be exceptions, but this is the general pattern. Reducing the uncertainty to a non-overwhelming level often results in abatement of symptoms, regardless of medication. The uncertainty model also helps explain temporary anxieties, like choice paralysis.And for the efficacy of SSRIs and other selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors: reducing the range of signal transduction easily explains affect flattening and thus a reductikn in depression symptoms. It works like this: Reduce NT reuptake =&gt; increase synaptic NT level for a given presynaptic stimulus =&gt; decrease dendritic NT receptor density. This results in a system where the synaptic NT concentration range is narrowed (higher min, lower max), leading to a narrowed range of signal transduction, which we experience as emotions feeling less intense in either valence (happy or sad). If a person is used to feeling extra sad at the time and not much happy, then SSRI brain is preferable. For folks with more bipolar-type depression, SSRIs can *worsen* depression with the emotional flattening robbing the precious relief of mania.

21049,itlqwxi,askscience,"Thanks for your question dijThe umbrella paper didnt examine the causes of depression - it evaluated just the support for the serotonin hypothesis of depression. We outline it in more general terms here: [https://theconversation.com/depression-is-probably-not-caused-by-a-chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain-new-study-186672](https://theconversation.com/depression-is-probably-not-caused-by-a-chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain-new-study-186672)One thing that came up a lot in the studies was the strong relationship of stressful life events to risk of depression.As for SSRIs, this is an interesting topic - as there is a lot of debate about their short term impact. A few relevant issues: in studies of antidepressants versus placebo, everyone in the study has quite a large improvement in depression scores (this is how depression is measured in these studies) so everyone experiences quite an impact whether they are given sugar tablets or antidepressants. The difference in the effect of antidepressants compared to placebo (sugar tablets) is small. For some context: placebo reduces depression scores (of the 52 point Hamilton depression score rating scale) by 8 points over 6-8 weeks, and antidepressants do so by 9.8 points over 6-8 weeks. The difference is 1.8 points on this 52 point scale (about 1/4 the size of the placebo effect) and many people think that this does not count as a clinically important difference. (I.e. it is statistically significant, but the size of the difference is not enough to make a difference to someone - a bit like a diet pill that beats placebo statistically but only produces 50 grams of weight loss). So a large portion of the antidepressant effect is placebo - which is really all about hope and expectation. Another hypothesis about why people report such a positive effect from antidepressants is because they might numb your emotions - ie. turn down the volume on both positive and negative emotions (this might also relate to the numbing effects they have physically e.g. on genital tissue) which might be a great relief for someone in the middle of turmoil. There are lots of other scientific hypotheses for how antidepressants might work - but none are currently proven but they are often discussed.

21074,itlsol4,askscience,"Hey RTS, good questions. I think the first thing to say is that there has been very little research about the long term effects of antidepressant use on the brain - indeed pretty close to zero. A lot of research in the field is sponsored by drug companies and these focus on studies that show the drugs in a positive light so there has been little effort to look at the long term effects of the drugs, especially the potentially damaging effects of the drugs on the brain. so we only know a few things.1) the brain is a plastic organ and adapts to changes in the neurochemical environment. Humans operate under the principle of homeostasis - ie we try to keep things in the middle. If it is too hot outside, our bodies cool down - and vice versa. In response to the abnormally high levels of serotonin that most commonly used antidepressants generate the brain will become less sensitive to serotonin - ie. down-regulate serotonin receptors etc. This has been shown to occur in neuroimaging of people who are taking antidepressants and some studies show that these sort of changes can last months or years after stopping the drug. There are presumably a number of other changes that happen downstream of serotonin receptors but these have not been studied. there are also studies showing that there are greater reductions in the brain volume of people who are depressed who take antidepressants than those who are depressed but dont take antidepressants. Antidepressants cause concentration difficulties, sleep disruption and memory impairments in the short term and in the long term there is some observational evidence that they increase the risk of dementia (especially cholinergic ones) and it is not clear if these effects and changes relate to the neurobiological changes outlined above.2. there are a lot of serotonergic neurons in the gut so antidepressants will affect these and not just those in the brain. This is why people think that antidepressants cause gut adverse effects (sometimes called side effect). I am sorry I dont know the details of how the gut is affected specifically by antidepressants, just that anorexia, weight gain, diarrhoea, constipation and nausea are common effects of antidepressants (some of which might be via a gut mechanism - but may also be hormonal or central). 3. I am not spruiking any new compound!

21101,itlznn5,askscience,"This is one of the most prominent theories for how antidepressants may affect the brain - by growing new neurons. And actually I did my PhD in a lab looking specifically at this hypothesis and part of my PhD was on this topic. In fact, it was learning about hippocampal neurogenesis that got me so excited about this field and led to me pursuing a PhD in how antidepressants work.But I think there is alternative way of looking at this that is not often discussed. Strokes, chemical insults to the brain and electrical currents also cause neurogenesis in the brain. That is, the brain responds to toxic insults by a repair mechanism that involves the growth of new brain cells. Ketamine for instance is widely recognised to be neurotoxic (cause damage to the brain) in animal models.I am currently working with some colleagues on a paper in which rodents were given an antidepressant at the rodent-equivalent dose to the human dose and half of them had seizures. Because of the lab rules these animals had to be sacrificed and were not allowed to be further examined. But the remaining animals had extremely high levels of neurogenesis. So perhaps the toxicity of the drug caused seizures and neurogenesis, suggesting that neurogenesis might not be evidence of a helpful effects.  So it may be that neurogenesis in the brain in response to different chemicals is not a sign that they are helpful but that they are causing toxicity which leads to a protective response to compensate. This would be consistent with the long term effects discussed above - e.g. long lasting post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, protracted withdrawal syndromes, and the cognitive impairments caused by antidepressants (and some evidence of increased risk of dementia in long-term users).",safedeprescribing,85,0,1666631066,itkxlj9,yc89rq,1667896969,0,False,0.7267566323280334,0.7146965,oofin_and_boofin

This is much lower than things like height which are 80%+.These studies have also been criticised for attributing more to genetics than to the environment by under-estimating the role of shared environments. The work of Jay Joseph has focused on this. But even if we accept this 37% as correct - it means that the vast majority of the cause of depression is environmental. Depression seems to be best understood as the reaction of mammals to adversity/stress/lack of met needs. I am sure that there are genetic variation in how susceptible people are to this state but I think it is not the most useful approach to understanding depression - you cant change peoples genetics. Whereas we know there are lots of things you can do to create security, meet needs etc that help depression - so to me the keys are in focusing on the environmental and psychological factors.To underline this there was a huge study looking at all the genetic variants that have been thought to cause depression. Every single one came up with no effect. Even though the study was not aiming to look at this what came up very strongly was: stressful life events.

The book is mostly motivational/philosophical but there are a couple of things that stood out to me. Here’s an example: “The sun is seen to pour itself down and expend itself in all directions, yet it is never exhausted … [watch a sunbeam] as it streams into a darkened room through a narrow chink. It prolongs itself forward in a straight line, until it is held up by encountering one solid body which blocks the passage to the air beyond and then it remains at rest there, without slipping off or falling away. The emission and diffusion of thought should be the counterpart of this: not exhausting, but simply extending itself; not dashing violently or furiously against the obstacles it encounters, not yet falling away in despair; but holding its ground and lighting up that upon which it rests”.

For all things are formed in nature to change and be turned and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession may exist”.

Tapering more slowly reduces the intensity of withdrawal symptoms and gives time for the brain to adapt to the lower levels of the drug. We also recommend going at a pace that the patient can tolerate - rather than just issuing a set of dose reductions which can often backfire. Some people can tolerate quicker reductions, others cannot - we are still working on the what determines this - but the best approach is to titrate rate of reduction to what the person can tolerate. The hyperbolic part: the relationship between dose of drug and its effect on the brain (e.g inhibition of the serotonin transporter but also other receptor targets) is hyperbolic. Hard to explain this without a picture but basically the effect on the brain goes up very steeply for small doses and then plateaus at the doses normally used in clinical practice. You can see the pictures here in a free link to the paper: https://markhorowitz.org/academic-paper/tapering-of-ssri-treatment-to-mitigate-withdrawal-symptoms/What this means is that if you reduce the drug by linear amounts e.g. 20mg, 15mg, 10mg, 5mg, 0mg as is often done in clinical practice the effect on the brain becomes larger and larger each time. Ill give an example for citalopram one of the most commonly used antidepressants:20 to 15mg dose reduction: 3% reduction in effect on the brain15 to 10mg dose reduction: 6% reduction in effect on the brain10mg to 5mg dose reduction: 13% reduction in effect on the brain5mg to 0mg dose reduction: 58% reduction in effect on the brainI/e the perturbation or change to the brain gets hyperbolically larger the more you go down. So the way to taper is to reduce dose hyperbolically - which means you make smaller and smaller dose reductions so that the change in effect on the brain remains constant.So keeping with the citalopram example:Reducing from 20mg to 5.4mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brainReducing from 5.4mg to 2.3mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brainReducing from 2.3mg to 0.8mg : 20% reduction in effect on the brainReducing from 0.8mg to 0mg: 20% reduction in effect on the brainThis pattern of dose reduction is called hyperbolic tapering because it follows the hyperbolic pattern of the drugs. Now many people will find these 4 dose jumps too large so you can insert intermediate steps in between them also following a hyperbolic pattern And you can work out what rate of reduction someone can tolerate by following this pattern, Lastly, people often need support during this process because it can be unpleasant as the neurobiological changes cause emotional and physical withdrawal symptoms so it is good to have some sort of support during the process.

No meta-analysis (summary of all studies) has ever demonstrated that antidepressants produce a clinically important difference from placebo (although they show statistically significant differences). I agree that it is very difficult to get independent data in medical sciences because of the massive conflicts of interest in who runs the studies. This is particularly true for AD research.

21187,itm5pct,askscience,"I think all the evidence points to depression being a perfectly natural reaction to oppressive circumstances. Study after study shows incredibly strong relationships between how many stressful life events someone experiences - relationship breakdown, job loss, physical illness, etc - and their chance of developing depression in the following months. Low wages and poor living conditions are chronic stressors that also clearly influence risk of depression. Neuroticism - how sensitive you are to stress - also seems to play some role in risk of depression (and this may be where early life experiences or genetics come in to play). Depression is best conceptualised as a mammalian response to overwhelming stress or threat - it occurs in dogs exposed to inescapable shock, to monkeys removed from their troop, etc. It is a common response to environmental stress.As for your proposition I think once you understand the above you might see that societal interventions like addressing poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions would be the most sensible response to depression - addressing the causes rather than papering over the problems with drugs that might numb or provide hope through the placebo effect or in some cases produce a short lived euphoria. I think it is becoming clearer that overall the drugs are not producing overall positive effects - they cause all sorts of negative physical effects, numb emotions, impair cognition, can undermine peoples abilities to cope with adversity so I do not think they are a life boat. At the same time I am not sure that therapy is always the best answer - although it can be helpful. If the main problem is financial insecurity then no amount of therapy will help that. But therapy can help people understand how they have ended up in certain circumstances or patterns and work on strategies. But as implied in your question we really should understand depression as an understandable response to social adversity so we can be more clear about the solutions - addressing social adversity.

But I now think that this is a mostly misguided way to study depression. We become depressed when we are overwhelmed and our needs are not met. The most important study comes from understanding how best to address these problems. This involves politics and social theory and psychology, etc. Of course the brain is involved in depression in a truistic sense but I dont think depression is a brain illness that requires us to understand the brain to help people. Mostly this makes me think of someone talking to a friend who says they feel hopeless and despairing since their partner died. It would take a particular sort of person to say I need to study your brain to understand what is *really* going on in this depression of yours. What are the neurochemical causes of it? When I work that out I will be able to truly get to the root of what is wrong.  Or another example - when we learn a new language, say Japanese, certainly our brain changes - the electricity and chemistry will be modified in some way. But if a student of japanese said they were going to stop attending japanese class but instead start studying the brains of people who know Japanese to work out the exact pattern of electrical and chemical changes that underlie this state, you would be pretty sure they were heading in the wrong direction. I think the same is true in the study of depression - we are mistaking a software problem for a hardware problem. When Word crashes we dont open up the hard disk to try to understand what has gone wrong with the circuits, we need to address the program.

21371,itm77bk,askscience,"Hey napsack, Good question!There are several reasons why a doctor would recommend this in the first place which I will summarise briefly:-the drug was never effective (recent studies have estimated that 15% of people given antidepressants benefit from them in the short term - and there is evidence that even less do well in the long term)-the drug was originally effective but the effect has worn off - most psychoactive drugs wear off over time - this is called tolerance, sometimes colourfully called poop out in the US - and so they may no longer be doing anything beneficial-the drug has been used beyond guidelines. Most antidepressants are recommended to be used for 6-12 months, and only using them for longer when there are serious risk factors. But we know many people are on these drugs for many years and some for decades-adverse effects outweigh benefits. There are many adverse effects some mentioned above including sexual side effects, cognitive problems, emotional numbing, weight gain which each affect about 1 in 4 or 1 in 2 patients on antidepressants. There are also long term potential physical health effects - antidepressants have been found to increase risk of the following in large-scale observational studies: weight gain, diabetes, stroke, falls, cardiovascular disease, bleeding, low blood sodium, premature death, and for some drugs dementia. They also increase the risk of foetal abnormalities in pregnant mothers (although the absolute risk remains low antidepressants are thought to double or triple various foetal abnormalities)  -patient choice - people want to stop them-and the drugs may worsen the outcomes of the conditions they are meant to treat according to some analyses-lastly, people are often kept on drugs to prevent future relapse of their condition. But the research that finds that the drugs prevent relapse has recently been called into question because withdrawal effects from antidepressants may have been mistaken for relapse and so it is not clear whether antidepressants do prevent relapse - they may just be preventing withdrawal effects from antidepressants-the longer you stay on antidepressants the harder it is to stop them because your risk of withdrawal effects increases with time",safedeprescribing,35,0,1666633976,itlgbqi,yc89rq,1667896759,0,False,0.6994877457618713,0.64558315,napsack_

21402,itm8s44,askscience,"1. I have outlined the adverse effects for antidepressants in general above which will apply to sertraline. Common effects include weight gain, emotional numbing, memory and concentration impairment, daytime fatigue, sleep disruption, sexual problems. Some people have agitation or worsened mood. In the long term there seems to be an increased risk of weight gain, diabetes, stroke, falls, fractures, bleeding and increased risk of premature mortality. 2. I dont know the specific relationship between serotonin and feeling tired. But I do know that this is a very common adverse effect of SSRIs like sertraline. It may be that these drugs induce fatigue directly but it also may be that the daytime fatigue, tiredness is caused by the sleep architecture disruption caused by antidepressants. SSRIs clearly disrupt normal sleep structures and this is why they probably have an effect on dreaming (decreased or absent) and may explain why there is memory and concentration impairments and also day time tiredness. 3. Yes it is.

They compared the lumps of metal to the original, declared the one that was closest to the original to be the new International Kilogram, and sent the other copies (with documentation as to how much they differed from the International Kilogram) to the standards bureaus of the participating countries to use as National Standards. These countries make copies, calibrated against their National Standard, copies of those are made, subdivided, etc, until the set of weights in your certified balance in your lab have a chain of calibrations going back to the International Kilogram.The same is true of the Yard (once a bar of metal in the Tower of London) and the Metre. It was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance along the meridian through Paris from the North pole to the equator. After taking 10 years to measure it, they made a bar with that distance marked on it and made that the official metre. In 1889, they replaced that bar with a better designed one.The metre and second have been redefined a few times since then, as techniques for precision measurement of time and distance have improved. The second went from being defined in terms of the length of a day (which, it turns out, slowly changes) to the frequency of a particular spectral emission. The metre went from being defined in terms of a physical artifact to a certain number of wavelengths of light from Krypton-86, then was redefined in terms of the speed of light.",buddhabuck,15,0,1666707127,itpsu29,ycuvur,1667892893,0,False,0.9510856866836548,0.5737933,inappropriateta

21992,itr3m2f,askscience,"You can think of primary motor cortex as a clickable map of all the muscles in your body. The map can be clicked by either side of your brain, causing that muscle to move. However, half of the map physically resides in one hemisphere, and the other half resides in the other hemisphere. If a hemisphere is lost, then the map is lost and a person will become hemiplegic.  This is the same reason why some people are hemiplegic after a stroke. Note that in very young children, the brain can rebuild the map in the remaining hemisphere. But it is very difficult for adults to regain function.On the other hand, a callosotomy severs some of the structures that the brain uses to reach across and click the map on the opposite hemisphere. It does not sever *all* of the structures and methods used to transmit information across hemispheres. For example, both hemispheres still have indirect visual and proprioceptive input regarding what is happening on the contralateral side.So its hard to predict what will happen, but generally it will be more difficult to coordinate movements. [Heres what happened to one patient:](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10541755/)&gt; We examined bimanual coordination in a patient before and after each stage of callosotomy surgery. We tested how well the patient coordinated movement direction between the hands. The patient drew symmetrical or asymmetrical figures simultaneously with both hands. Before surgery, symmetrical figures were drawn well and asymmetrical figures were drawn poorly. Following anterior callosotomy, the drawings improved slightly. Symmetrical figures were still drawn well, and asymmetrical ones were still drawn poorly. Thus, spatial integration remained intact despite the loss of interhemispheric communication between frontal cortical sites. After posterior callosotomy, spatial coordination deteriorated significantly. Mirror-image drawings became less symmetrical, while asymmetrical drawings improved. These data indicate that the posterior callosum mediates the coordination of direction information between the hands during bimanual movements. Given the topographical organization of the corpus callosum, this integration is likely carried out by parietal cortex.",fastspinecho,2,0,1666721271,itr105v,ycrf85,1667891885,0,False,0.9901461601257324,0.6054911,mescaleeto

22088,itrlywk,askscience,"&gt;Follow on question then. When we take conscious control of an autonomic function like blinking or breathing or facial control...&gt;I have to first clarify that theres a difference between automated functions and autonomic. The first place to start is the different types of nerve fibers that are classified based on whether theyre general or specialized (i.e. special senses like optic, olfactory, and taste), somatic or visceral (skeletal muscle vs smooth muscle or gland), and afferent vs efferent (transporting information to or from the CNS; sensory vs motor).When we talk about the autonomic nervous system, were referencing visceral fibers (e.g. GVE, GVA) and visceral fibers can not be consciously controlled.But the functions you mentioned (breathing, blinking, and facial muscle control) are all somatic (specifically GSE) and not autonomic. But many somatic functions are automated to an extent. Theres a circuit in the brainstem that regulates oxygen saturation in the blood and will keep the respiratory system going at a stay rhythm to maintain, but they are skeletal muscles (diaphragm and intercostals) and they are under somatic (GSE) control. A lot of muscles, like postural muscles, have separate spinal cord tracts for the continuous automation of activating those muscles so that you dont simply fall to the floor like a rag doll when you stop thinking about standing up straight, but theyre still somatic and you can re-take control at any time you choose.Youd be surprised how many somatic functions actually require minimal conscious input. Like throwing a ball; you dont usually think about which muscles and how much to contract them and in which order when you throw a ball; you just think about throwing it and where you want it to go. Your cerebellum has the pre-scripted details on how to actually throw (and hit the target), does the internal math and modifies the base plan to hit the intended target and then it just runs that program upon request. But your comciousness doesnt need to perform all of those tasks. You just want to throw the ball.

Even if you try to use the principle of including all information, its not clear where to stop. Youll just worry that you needed to choose A0: Juliet won twice, at 9PM, and the weather was cloudy both times. Compared to P(A1), P(A0) is another order of magnitude lower.But if you realize that you actually care about, not P(A1), ..., P(A7), but P(R|A1), ..., P(R|A7), then its easy to see that adding cloudiness does not actually change the result. In a Bayesian formulation of the problem, only relevant information matters. P(R|A0) = P(R|A1). You can ignore the weather.The point of the last statement in the previous post is that, if you know no particular distinguishing information about Juliet, you can calculate P(R|A) or P(R|J) and it doesnt matter, because you still get the same answer.

What, if anything, is between you and the explosion? Can you escape the fallout? What are you wearing? Etc. etc. Iodine is not going to contribute much to your total dose in many, maybe most, plausible scenarios of experiencing nuclear warfare. Prompt radiation could be a big contributor if you’re in line of sight, for example -assuming you survive the fireball, the heat, the shockwave and the debris. If it was a ground burst, the radioactive dust and micro-particles that you would be inhaling would likely be a much bigger issue. Your thyroid gland is also most likely pretty full of iodine already if you’re from a developed country. Most countries add it to table salt, and it doesn’t take much before your thyroid is full of it. Iodine pills are by no way guaranteed to help you any, and if you rely on them to protect you from the radiation from a nuclear bomb, you’re going to have a bad time.

Moving that scale can have a dramatic affect on its accuracy at the new location. Weights and measures authorities have and use gravitational maps to determine where these scales can be used without recalibrating.  Canada even uses an online calculator to determine if a scale calibrated, for example, in downtown Toronto can be used.accurately in Whitehorse without requiring recalibration.

There are trace amounts of (very dilute) methanol in some naturally-fermented alcohols like fruit wines iirc, but in a non-distilled drink the ratio of ethanol-methanol is so in favor of ethanol that any toxic effects of the methanol are negated, but if you distill that same alcohol and don’t do it right (not taking care to boil off any possible methanol content), *then* serious health risks definitely arise (also, this is also part of why freeze distillation isn’t more common even though it on the surface appears easier and safer than heat distillation; doing it with a lot of types of alcohol carries a real risk of concentrating methanol without any heat to evaporate it away).I’ve also seen a theory blaming methanol for absinthe’s (fictitious) historical reputation as a hallucinogen, but personally I find that really unlikely just because enough methanol to cause that severe of symptoms would likely just be outright deadly, and there are much better explanations for the mythology around absinthe (myths propagated by a moral panic and perpetuated by artists and counterculturalists, alcoholics mistaking delirium tremens or possibly severe drunkenness for something more exotic, and exaggeration of the very mild psychoactive effects of the thujone in wormwood).",regular_modern_girl,19,0,1666760144,itt9rit,ydc8h6,1667888801,0,False,0.7246058583259583,0.6627737,roywig

The strain gauge load cell would be used in lower quality electronic scales while high end scales use proprietary load cells some based on changing frequency of a vibrating wire as tension is added.You are absolutely correct though that high precision mechanical scales exist and predated electronic scales. In the interim there were electro-mechanical scales. Actually lots of high precision scales are still electromechanical with the lever system taking the main load and allowing the electronics to resolve the final weight without having to deal with excess loads.Balances are another option and are quite simple, although using them properly is less so. They also require the use of high precision weights which are quite expensive.In any case, mechanical scales have been around for a long time and are very reliable. Electronic scales are readily available and cheap ones provide surprisingly good resolution albeit usually with some concessions in accuracy and mostly poor repeatability.

Used mechanical or electromechanical balances from school and commercial laboratories are available.on the used market and provide a great value if they work well.

Those who got a mild dose have a life expectancy of just 3 months lower than the unexposed population due to slightly elevated cancer over expected baseline for Japan.2. Those who got a high, but survivable dose, lost 1.3 years of life expectancy due slightly elevated cancer (but more than the above rate).3. The children of the survivors are indistinguishable from the general population in all respects.Thats your reality.  But you dont see that.

In the sense of repeatability its virtually impossible to create absolute optimal conditions to test the growth patterns of an organism that requires thousands of years and a complex, relatively stable ecosystem to survive.Yet the [oldest trees are not the tallest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_longaeva) either. Many trees will not get tall if theyre not surrounded by other trees. So right away you can see theres a sequence of spacing and competition while forests, after all, are also codependent/mutualists that exchange nutrients between species through mycorrhizal networks. Characteristics of trees (such as size) are a result of several adaptive, interconnected processes all of which we may not even be aware of yet. For example, our anthropocentric sense of time would have great difficulty understanding successive processes that an old-growth forest requires to create conditions for giant trees to emerge. You may need to have a several hundred year old forest grow to climax height, eventually die tree by tree of old age, become massive repertoire for micro- and macrofauna and flora in order to create a local climate and water+nutrient cycle that is prerequisite for certain trees to finally break the existing canopy and get really, really tall and old. Watching paint dry and eventually peel off can only begin to describe the time required for these natural processes, while all we can see now is bunch of trees as if theyre the final product.",delukse,2,0,1666792057,itqv190,yd5wo0,1667886753,0,False,0.9777821898460388,0.7096241,doriscrockford

22936,itvaxls,askscience,"Youre asking a very good question and we understand some aspects of it, but not all of them, nor is there a single comprehensive theory that fully explains all aspects of memory storage and retrieval. But first, one point of clarification, most neurons are not replaced during life. Except for sensory neurons in the olfactory bulb and a sub-set of neurons in the hippocampus, the neurons we have in our brains are the same throughout our lives.Just to get encoding/decoding out of the way, information the obtain through our sensory receptors is parceled out (primarily through the thalamus and related ganglia) to different regions of our cerebral cortex: vision (occipital lobe), somatosensory (parietal lobe), auditory (temporal lobe), higher cognitive function (frontal lobe), and movement and motor skills (cerebellum). For movement or behavior in general, the individual draws from information saved in these areas.Now to address your question. In the cortical areas mentioned above, neurons contact other neurons at synapses (the places where neurotransmitters are released from one neuron to another to either increase (excitatory) or decrease (inhibitory) the potential of the second neuron firing. And thus it continues from neuron to neuron. When neurotransmitters repeatedly act in synapse, in addition to causing the post-synaptic neuron to fire, they elicit subtle changes both pre- and post-synaptically. Pre-synaptically, these changes include increases in the number of NT-containing vesicles formed along with enzymatic modifications to increase how much NT is released. Post-synaptically, the numbers of NT receptors increase, as do the numbers of dendrites, and other changes referred to collectively as post-synaptic densities. Over time and many thousands of times fired, the synapse becomes stronger or more able to fire (a model for this is calls it long-term potentiation or LTP).This is what happens at a single neuronal synapse and its the fundamental unit of memory, however note that each neuron receives input from about 1,000 neurons and provides output to another 1,000 neurons, and there are many, many neurons in the cortices (I dont recall how many, but theres an estimate for the entire brain of 10 to the 11th power thats sometimes mentioned.Somehow, all of these individual synaptic changes give rise to memories and learned behaviors, but alas, we dont understand the full sequence of how this processing occurs.",slouchingtoepiphany,13,1,1666799788,ituu5ve,ydyua0,1667885888,0,False,0.9694626927375792,0.54002964,hiding_behind_you

Moreover, we showed significant correlations between IQ scores and network properties across all subjects while controlling for age and gender. Specifically, higher intelligence scores corresponded to a shorter characteristic path length and a higher global efficiency of the networks, indicating a more efficient parallel information transfer in the brain. The results were consistently observed not only in the binary but also in the weighted networks, which together provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of brain structural organization may be an important biological basis for intelligence.______________Fractional anisotropy used for tissue integrity also has the opposite pattern as far as intelligence vs creativity goes. _______________https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-45679-001?doi=1These findings suggest that Big C creativity is associated with more “random” rather than more “efficient” global network functional architecture, with condition-dependent variations in local clustering and efficiency.

Surely youve heard about Einsteins famous relation, E=mc^(2), yes?  A given amount of mass is equivalent to a corresponding amount of energy, and vice-versa.  So, if you have enough energy, you can create particles with up to however much mass corresponds to that much energy.&gt;The Law of Conservation of Mass states that particles cannot be created.No, it doesnt, because there is no law of conservation of mass.  There is only conservation of energy.Mass is *approximately* conserved in chemical interactions, but even in chemical interactions there are small variations in mass for most interactions because of effects like binding energy and the [mass defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#Mass_defect), or the release of energy in exothermic reactions.But either way, there really is no such thing as a law of conservation of mass, and even if there was, such a law would *only* say that mass is conserved, it would not say anything about particles not being allowed to be created.  Remember:  mass and particles are different things.  Particles are real physical entities; mass is just a numeric property that particles have, like energy, electric charge, or velocity.

Power showers contain a pump to boost pressure in tank fed systems, electric do not and just use mains pressure.

They should only be used on a system with vented water tanks. (Also if your water pressure is fine you simply wouldnt use one). Cold only feed power showers exist (if youre unfortunate enough to have a cold water tank) but they are rather rare and most power showers blend hot/cold with pumps on both/one feed.

Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.And when this happens, backflow can contaminate the public drinking supply with:Fertilizers/pesticidesHuman wasteChlorine from pools/spasSoap from sinks/dishwashers/showersAnd that’s where a backflow prevention system comes in handy.Backflow prevention systems are devices installed onto a pipe that only allow water to flow in one direction.Think of it as a one-way gate that allows water from the city’s public water supply to flow into your home’s piping but stops water if and when it ever tries to flow backwards into the main water supply.",kotoku,1,0,1666878241,itx2s45,ydyf7q,1667878870,0,False,0.8962643146514893,0.5493922,blscratch

24041,iu0qgfe,askscience,"Aside from the profit, money part, the rest of what you wrote is basically false. Most of the major drugmakers business relies on novel molecules, that is where the money is. Anyone involved in the drugmaking business knows this.You dont get a new patent or regulatory exclusivity when you combine two off-patent drugs (unless you can create a novel delivery mechanism that is superior to just taking the two drugs together; this is not easy to do, and it would need to go through clinical trials and apply for regulatory approval). In general there is no financial incentive for drugmakers to explore such combinations. Doctors and researchers will still look for these cost-effective combinations, but profit-driven drugmakers will not.(Perhaps youre thinking of drug compounding, which does combine off-patent drugs. This is done by pharmacies, not drugmakers. It is not very profitable compared to novel drug development, and it also doesnt usually involve any patents.)It is true that drugmakers will often test drugs in combination, especially in oncology space where many of the novel drugs are part of a combination regimen. But at least one of the agents will be novel -- otherwise there wouldnt be any financial incentive! These combinations must undergo clinical trials and file for regulatory approval, the same way a new drug used as a monotherapy would, and are very expensive to run (usually more expensive than a monotherapy trial).New vaccines dont happen because the main buyer of vaccines is usually governments (sometimes the govts of developing countries) rather than US commercial insurers, and therefore profitability is low. Also, many of the diseases that might be amenable to vaccination are very complex and our scientific understanding is not that good. HIV, Dengue, etc have complex biology with features that make vaccination extremely challenging. Another major, major issue is that we as humans are often not willing to pay much for preventative measures like vaccines; by contrast, we are willing to pay exorbitant amounts when s*** hits the fan and we or our loved ones are at imminent risk of dying (one of the reasons why cancer treatments can command such high prices, even ones with limited benefit). We often say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but in reality, society does not set the price of medicines based on this adage.As for antibiotics, the reason why we dont see many new ones is because there just isnt that much unmet medical need there. Weve got antifungals and antibacterials, for the vast majority of patients they work. For cases that are refractory to first line treatments, we usually have second line treatments as well. Diseases that dont have large unmet medical need arent going to be highly profitable.Your take on neuroscience drugs is completely wrong. Dementia (such as for Alzheimers disease, or AZD) has huge unmet medical need, and therefore this space has MASSIVE profit potential. These diseases are devastating to the patient and their caregivers -- I really cannot describe it in words, you need to hear testimonials to really comprehend the depth of despair that AZD can cause -- and are also a very large burden on the healthcare system. I think the potential market space for a good AZD drug can be as big as any treament for a cancer, an autoimmune disease, or a metabolic disease. The financial incentive to find treatments for dementia cannot be understated. However, development is slow because our scientific understanding of the brain simply is not very good. Moreover, many drugmakers, biotech companies, and investors have been burned badly by failures in the past. Why pour money or a lifetime of research effort into this disease when so many other promising companies and genius scientists have failed? On the bright side, recently there has been some limited regulatory success in the AZD space due to amyloid-beta drugs (AB), but were still in the early stage of understanding this class of drugs, and so far the one approved drug (aducanumab) has not been commercially successful and its clinical data so far has not that convincing.",kyo20,13,0,1666894709,iu0emed,yere7r,1667876913,0,False,0.8675362467765808,0.804323,dragoonxnucleon

So yes, if you charged $3 billion for that first dose, every other one is just cost of manufacturing, but depending on some compound (like biologics, manufacturing is actually quite expensive). However thats not how it works. A drug company gets very little time on market to make their drug before generics can come in (10 years or now often less). So say we get 10 years are best to make back that $3 billion with zero profit.  If we sell a million doses a year, each shot is $300 just to break even. The moment a generic manufacturer can come in, your ability to recoup the investment is essentially zero. Vaccines are exceptionally tricky, unless you are selling them to governments, people will not buy them at the cost it took to make them or the vaccine is often a one time injection instead of a lifetime of pills.

You correctly expect a positron on the right side of your reaction because of conservation of electric charge.. But why? Well conservation of electric charge is a consequence of the law of the force of electomagnetism. In radioactive decays the Weak interaction comes into play and is in some ways similar to the electromagnetic force (and different in some ways and slightly more complicated). But it is similar in the way that there are also charges that must be conserved in the Weak interaction. In particular there is something called lepton number for each flavour of lepton which are the electron, muon and tauon. And this lepton number must be conserved.But this comment on the neutrino and momentum conservation is indeed important, and it is an obvious question - why do we need the neutrino. Historically we saw several types of radioactive decay and some of them (alpha and gamma) always had a fixed energy of the emitted particle e.g. gamma decay of an excited nucleus A*-&gt;A+gamma. Energy and momentum conservation of such a process where 1 particle turns into 2 predicts that the emitted particle will always have the same energy in every decay.However for beta decays where an electron is emitted it was observed that the electron energy was a spectrum up to some upper energy - contradicting the 1 to 2 particle decay and therefore physicists postulated the existence of an additional very light particle being emitted in this decay such that the energy was split between the electron and the postulated neutrino as this could explain the spectrum seen.

If a bacterial infection is resistant to treatment, additional antibiotics will be added in combination. Investigational antibiotics may also be used if the benefit outweighs the risk.

The the examples you give are where the bonds can more easily be broken because the intermediate states are more easily reached. I.e. before the O2 is separated out most first have the bonds Bricker and both O2 would be so reactive that in the time they are separate they would just bond back to one another. This requires a lot of energy i.e. to make something catch fire you need to first provide enough energy to do this, usually with something very hot. In our bodies the intermediate state where they are not bound or loosely bound is stabilized by specific molecules in our body making it easier to break the bond in O2. Since this intermediate state is stabilized you dont need the large initial energy to initiate the reaction (some energy is still needed). However, the energy produced is still the same as it depends on the final and initial states only. Edit: while this is true often there is more than one reaction happening such as enthalpy of solvation, solvent- solvent integrations, and solvent solute interactions. That said the bond energy of NaCl is 787 kj/Mol and O2 is 498 kj/mol.Is point out as well your teacher is not correct. Ionic bonds are stronger. But, in an aqueous state they can much more easily be solvated due to water stabilizing the intermediates. Ionic bonds since they do not share electrons, once separated are very easily stabilized.

25079,iu5gtzn,askscience,"I disagree. That energy you quote for NaCl assumes the two ions are pulled apart in vacuum. If we then move the respective ion into water, there is a favourable solvation free energy. So the free energy of the final state of separated NaCl in *aqueous solution* is different than had it been done in vacuum. Any intermediate state stabilization, that only alters the kinetics, is not relevant.The O2 example is, I admit, a bit different in the details. But in vacuum, if I do a homolytic cleavage of the covalent bond in O2, the two radical oxygen atoms of the final state are far from stable. So any other reactant that can combine with the two oxygen atoms make that final state stabler. The tricker part is that the path from start to finish include at least one transition state. In biology and chemistry, we can alter the kinetics of this cleavage, while leaving the final state the same, by adjusting any catalytic component. That is a more subtle point. My argument is much simpler. In vacuum, O2 is a strong bond because the final state after dissociation is unstable, while in the example system, O2 separates more readily *mostly* because the dissociation does *not* generate two free radical atoms, but one where the atomic oxygen binds to iron.Hence, the strength of a bond must either be defined with a common reference state (vacuum typically as I mention), but then bond strength is a more abstract quantity and less informative of practical questions of stability, robustness etc, or we consider the problem in full, i.e. the stability of initial and final states are part of the analysis.",smorgasconfigurator,0,0,1666980778,iu5d8ql,yff8um,1667869025,0,False,0.9622579216957092,0.70362693,putrid-repeat

25328,iu8tjlf,askscience,"It looks like theres no definitive pathophysiology of sundowning, but several evidence-based hypotheses as to why it likely occurs.TL;DR: parts of the brain effecting circadian rhythms, behavioral regulation, and stress response are changed/damaged. Environment and fatigue can also play a role.According to Canevelli et al., 2016:Sundowning could caused by a disruption in circadian rhythm due to alteration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), basically the pacemaker of circadian rhythyms, located in the hypothalamus (forebrain). This naturally degenerates with age, but damage to this area is seen even more so in people with AD, as noted by neuronal loss and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. In severe AD, the SCN also shows reactive gliosis (the universal response to brain injury) in response to neuronal loss, with an increase in the astrocyte/neuron ratio. Essentially, a physiological response to brain injury in the hypothalamus interfering with regulation of sleep and emotional activity.Additionally, circadian rhythms are regulated by melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland in response to darkness. The pineal glands Melatonin functions are regulated by the SCN (which we know is damaged in AD). Melatonin is usually greatly reduced in people with AD, effecting circadian rhythms.Another possible cause is the degeneration of the cholinergic system. The SCN receive several cholinergic projections arising from the cholinergic forebrain and brain stem nuclei. Moreover, it is sensitive to cholinergic stimulation as demonstrated by the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors both in SCN neurons and astroglial cells. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the impaired cholinergic transmission may contribute to the disruption of circadian rhythms and the emergence of behavioral disturbances (Canevelli et al., 2016)Another hypothesis is disruption/dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In several studies, people with AD showing sundowning had significantly higher cortisol levels (stress response, regulated by HPA) than those without sundowning.Lastly, environmental impacts such as decreased light exposure during the day (in a facility), fewer staff in late afternoon/evening, fatigue, and changes to or absence of daily routine have been associated with an overall worsening of NPS and the emergence of sundown syndrome",orange-enough,3,0,1667050136,iu7wmu6,yfothk,1667863466,0,False,0.9823828935623168,0.7281725,i4vhagar

The binding energy of the moon exceeds its orbital kinetic energy by a factor of 3 or so.You may well melt it or turn it inside out but youre not gonna splatter it completely just by deorbitting it. Rest assured that after colliding the moon into an indestructible immovable massless wall at orbital speed, it will, in fact, bounce.Indeed, the moon is one of the few objects in the solar system whos binding energy exceeds its orbital kinetic energy relative to its parent body. This definitely isnt true of Earth or Mars. Nor either of Mars tiny captured moons in low orbits with almost no gravity.

25366,iua0nsa,askscience,"Good question! Its indirect. For example, we can measure the circular orbit velocities of stars. Dark matter must have the same circular orbit velocity (i.e. velocity of a dark matter particle that is on a circular orbit), because its subject to the same gravity. Thats not yet the velocity dispersion, but its close.Next, we have observational evidence (e.g. rotation curves, lensing) that dark matter halos extend much farther than galaxies. This suggests that unlike the ordinary matter, the dark matter cannot efficiently cool -- otherwise it would condense into the galaxies as well. In fact the dark matter halos around large galaxies are consistent with what we find in simulations of dark matter that only interacts gravitationally. This suggests that dark matter is effectively collisionless in this context.Since dark matter halos form by nearly isotropic collapse and accretion -- dark matter comes in from all directions -- their net angular momentum is small. Thus they should have very little net rotational motion and almost all random motion. This is also what the same simulations tell us.The specific number 270 km/s was a quick estimate I made by taking the [isothermal sphere model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_isothermal_sphere_profile), which is a good approximation for galactic halos over a pretty wide range of radii, and noting that its velocity dispersion is sqrt(3/2) its circular velocity.

Also it wasnt nearly consensus that aether existed, there was quite a lot of debate all throughout that period as to whether light was a wave (one that travelled in a presumed medium — an aether of some sort) or whether light was a particle or corpuscule (and hence a form of matter that did not require a medium within which to propagate).  Various people proposed either/both wave- or particle-based theories of light and experiments continued to both confirm and refute aspects of each proposed model, all the way from their inception into the early 20th century.  The problems with both kinds of models only really began to start being resolved with the advent of early quantum mechanics and the emergence of wave-particle duality as a feature in physics.With the dark matter situation however, you have dozens of kinds of observations that are all in general agreement about dark matter, while those same observations are largely contradicted by the predictions of modified-gravity models.  Unlike with the aether, this isnt a situation where nobodys model fits all the data; with dark matter there is a clear matter-based model that *does* fit all of the data, and then a bunch of alternative models that dont.

25399,iub3tz8,askscience,"Uhhh ... its been happening for basically as long as weve known dark matter existed?  The first real evidence for dark matter started coming in [almost 100 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Early_history), in the 1930s and 1940s.  The earliest dark matter models were overly simple — just treating galaxies as if they had extra mass — and they had various problems.  Throughout the following decades, models of the cosmos became increasingly sophisticated ... and increasingly conflicted, as every model had some seemingly irreconcilable problems (regardless of dark matter) so it wasnt clear which model was the correct, or even the closest to correct.  As I understand it, during the early 1980s the first modern models of dark matter were proposed, with distributions not matching those of baryonic matter.  And with the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe and the need for a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy, in the late 1980s / early 1990s, enough evidence had come in for cosmologists to hone in on a model that resolved all the issues with the previous competing models — this model is known the Lambda-CDM model (lambda is the symbol for the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations, and CDM stands for cold dark matter); it is also known as the concordance model because it gracefully resolved all the outstanding problems with the previous models of cosmology, and fit the data much better than any of those other models.  Since that time, this model has become known as the standard model of cosmology and has stood out as effectively the only model that actually works and fits all of the data.  Dark matter has been a part of that model since its inception in the early 90s, and in the three decades since all sorts of tweaks, additions, and parameterizations of that model (including its dark matter aspect) have been explored ... as well as many alternative models, none of which have panned out and found success at fitting all of the data well.So dark matter has been an accepted part of the modern model of cosmology for at least 3 decades and weve had all manners of more complicated models (and attempts at alternative models) developed during that time.  All sorts of supercomputing simulations of structure formation in the cosmos have been run and their statistics compared to observational datasets, with gradual refinement of the narrower strokes as new data has come in from missions like WMAP and the Planck spacecraft.In summary, its been happening this entire time because thats what cosmologists do — thats their job.  Its not like theyve been slacking off for half a century; there are tens of thousands of cosmologists and astrophysicists worldwide who have been working on it doing formal research and experimentation/observation for their entire professional careers. :)",forte2718,11,0,1667086592,iuau5oh,ygfptx,1667859688,0,False,0.923420548439026,0.69066876,throw_every_away

In contrast, virtual or off-shell pairs can be created at far lower energies, but must only exist internal to the reaction.Also, whenever you can produce one kind of pair, you can also produce any kind of pair thats lighter than that one, unless theres some mechanism that explicitly suppresses its creation.

But oral infections and inflammation would be one of the most common infections/inflammatory responses seen in the population. Peripheral immune activation from something like a peripheral infection or inflammation causes a cocktail of molecules that enhance inflammatory states to be released into the blood. Were uncertain about the exact effect that these molecules have in the brain, as they do not pass the blood brain barrier. But they do interact with the cells that make up that barrier, which go on to communicate with neurons and other cells in the brain. Inflammation in the brain has been strongly associated with development of Alzheimers disease (the exact relationship is uncertain). I would suppose that the frequency, both individually and in the population, of infection or inflammation of oral tissue contributes to this association between this and Alzheimers or other neurological diseases. Illness is one of the environmental factors that contributes to development. I suspect if we saw infections and inflammation in other parts of the body as frequently as we do the oral tissues, they would also be significantly associated with Alzheimers disease. However, the mouth is exposed to a unique bacterial environment so it may also be the response to the specific pathogens that affect our gum tissue over other areas.

That is, more of the visual field measured along the axis of sight will be in approximate focus the smaller the eyeball. This might sound like a desirable property, and in some cases it is. But it reduces your ability to determine target distance through adjusting the optical properties of the eye, for example by flexing the lens or adjusting the pupil diameter. When you focus on something in the nearfield or midfield, with a smaller depth of field you get more information about the relative position of a target and its visual background than you do with a larger depth of field. In the case of a pinhole aperture which has, in theory, unlimited depth of field, you get no information at all about the distance to any of the objects in the scene based on their relative sharpness because everything has the same sharpness. For diurnal raptors, for example, a large depth of field isnt much of a disadvantage because theyre trying to acquire relatively small targets which are relatively far away and are pretty much always just about the same distance away as their visual background. If youre looking at a rabbit from above you dont need to have optical information to know that the rabbit is just about as far away as the ground. On the other hand, if you are a diurnal ape operating along the surface of the Earth looking at the horizon, and your typical hunting targets are at most single to double-digit meters away when you begin your attack, and which is often hunting targets with complicated backgrounds at different distances away, its pretty important to have the ability to distinguish how far away your target is in an absolute sense, as well as how far it is from its background. A larger eyeball, which, all other things being equal, gives you a smaller depth of field, helps in that aspect.In general, our brain does quite sophisticated visual processing on the information it receives from our eyeballs. [In fact, the image processing is so sophisticated that it allows us to surpass the physics of our eyes in some sense under certain conditions.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacuity_(scientific_term)) Obviously we are not actually breaking physics with our eyes, but taking advantage of the fact that we have a matrix of receptors and combining the signal from more than just one to provide information at a finer resolution than would be possible if one simply naively took the intensity values recorded by each receptor and displayed them without processing. One could argue that perhaps shrinking the eyeball would free up some space in the cranium for more brain, but in order to maintain the same visual abilities one would probably need to devote more of the brain to visual processing.",coomb,6,0,1667155386,iuddzsu,yh2qzc,1667854103,0,False,0.5626769661903381,0.6265453,aboubenadhem

26225,iuhloty,askscience,"&gt; This may be a silly question, but how much weight would it take to cause this?Mathematically, theres not a minimum threshold, but in practice, theres going to be mass distributions that are going to produce such a small predicted deflection they are not really measurable. The math for flexure is laid out in a variety of places, [Wickert, 2016](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/997/2016/gmd-9-997-2016.pdf) provides a pretty complete view if you cant get your hands on a copy of [Turcotte &amp; Schubert](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/geodynamics/E0E847DA9FE68BDB90C2E457791F0C98#overview). Thus, you can calculate the predicted flexure for any mass, but in practice, that mass may be insufficient to produce a measurable flexure. The other big complication here is that the response also depends on the duration of the load and/or the rate of change of the load through time as the way the lithosphere responds to loads (i.e., purely elastic, viscoelastic, etc.) depends on the rate of change of the load (e.g., [Watts et al., 2013](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105457)).&gt; Also, does it depend on the makeup of earth that sits below said weight?Yes. If you look through the math in Wickert, youll see a few terms that potentially vary with location, specifically the density contrast between the infilling material and the mantle and the flexural rigidity (D). For the former, this means that the density of the load (i.e., is it rock, water ice, liquid water, etc) matters, but also that theoretically the density of the mantle in that location matters. In practice, we often assume a standard density for the mantle (not necessarily always) so we dont often consider this term to vary by location (but in reality, it might). However, flexural rigidity definitely does vary by location. If you go to the appendix, youll see a definition for D that includes [Youngs modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus), the [Poisson ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio), and the [effective elastic thickness (Te)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_elastic_thickness_of_the_lithosphere). We typically assume Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio are constants for the lithosphere, but Te can vary a lot by location (e.g., [Watts, 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2117.1992.tb00043.x), [Burov &amp; Diament, 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB02770), [Burov, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817211001425)), e.g., the oceanic lithosphere generally has a narrow range of Te with most being ~10-20 km whereas continental lithosphere has a pretty wide range of Te with some in similar ranges as oceanic lithosphere but others being significantly thicker. The effective elastic thickness is kind of what the name implies, i.e., its an approximation of the thickness of a purely elastic sheet that would explain the observed deflection for a given mass distribution. Te is generally not a physical thing (many of the cited papers are trying to find relations between Te and something we can actually measure like crustal thickness, temperature profiles, age, etc) but is something we estimate from observed deflections (though for oceanic lithosphere, it is more explainable as a function of lithosphere age/temperature). In general, for the same surface mass and mass distribution lower Te means more local compensation, i.e., larger deflections with much shorter wavelengths, whereas larger Te means less deflection distributed over a much longer wavelength. In practice, Te is the main thing that we consider to vary as a function of location (and in turn, flexural ridigity) and this has a pretty important influence on how that area responds to a given load.",crustaltrudger,5,0,1667218223,iugjs74,yhesgi,1667848997,0,False,0.9564954042434692,0.63858366,fukkinchilll

Additionally, in most designs the radiation case is also constructed of a fissile material that undergoes fission driven by fast thermonuclear neutrons. Such bombs are classified as two stage weapons, and most current Teller–Ulam designs are such fission-fusion-fission weapons. Fast fission of the tamper and radiation case is the main contribution to the total yield and is the dominant process that produces radioactive fission product fallout.[2][3]The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I took it to mean that most of the yield is from the second fission process, not the fusion, which seemed surprising to me.
