# Reddit_Project

This repository contains the code for the Structural Competition and Aggressive Behavior project. The files/folders in the repo are-

Files

1. 'Node_Embeddings_For_Fifteen_Subreddits.ipynb' - Contains the code to create the networkX graph, and generate the node embeddings, and find the network similarity between the sender and receiver of comments from 15 subreddits.

2. 'Word_Embeddings_For_Fifteen_Subreddits.ipynb' - Contains the code to generate the mean word embedding (using SBERT) of a given user on the platform, and then calculate the difference in mean word embedding between a sender and a receiver pair who interacted via a comment on the platform.

3. 'Reading_Network_Similarity.ipynb' - 



Folders

1. Network_Graphs - This folder contains the python notebooks which were used to experiment with 3 levels of aggregation (submission, subreddit, the whole reddit data) to generate the graphs on different sizes of reddit data.
